        "transcription": "[00:00] Okay, so one of these presentations isn't like others because we're not actually trying to solve the problem per se.\n\n[00:08] We're talking about the meta about how to write about how we're trying to solve these problems.\n\n[00:13] So here we are talking about the roadmap project.\n\n[00:20] This is what Chatjipati thinks it should look like.\n\n[00:24] It still can't spell, but at least it looks very impressive.\n\n[00:28] So I think in many ways it's kind of obvious what this is all about.\n\n[00:36] There is the old roadmap. I think it's influenced a lot of us. It's been fairly useful.\n\n[00:42] Everybody's been going on for ages that we ought to do an update because stuff has happened.\n\n[00:48] And we should be trying to do that. Why should we do it?\n\n[00:52] Well, partially for our own sake. We actually might want to have a way of organizing our thoughts.\n\n[00:58] There have been a lot of really clever ideas coming up over the past hours, for example.\n\n[01:04] But we need to organize this in a better way. We need to have some common frames of reference.\n\n[01:10] It's also very useful for getting funders interested or getting companies interested.\n\n[01:15] Eventually, when we start talking to policymakers and the public about it,\n\n[01:19] we need to have something to point to that is a bit solid.\n\n[01:23] There are various papers like Randall's Success Criteria paper and other reviews of various particular methodologies\n\n[01:33] that obviously have moved things forward, but it might be nice to integrate it.\n\n[01:38] Now to the practical part, how do you actually write a roadmap?\n\n[01:43] The first one was more or less done by me. That was a small project.\n\n[01:48] But now it's getting bigger and we also need to get info from a lot more people.\n\n[01:52] So it's pretty clear that we want to have probably at least two leads.\n\n[01:56] Simply because if one drops the ball, the others can start saying, hey, what is going on?\n\n[02:02] Randall has chosen to be involved here. I don't know whether you're the general of this or so.\n\n[02:09] But at least I'm happy to point that I'm happy to be involved.\n\n[02:13] We should probably figure out a better organization for that.\n\n[02:16] And then once you have leads, then we want to get the new technical details in, add some of the new discussions.\n\n[02:25] When you think about what is the main bottleneck for success besides that we might still not write things,\n\n[02:32] I think part of it is defining the success criteria, because that is actually a key kind of almost philosophical thing\n\n[02:40] that is actually non-trivial, as we have been finding over the past few days.\n\n[02:45] There are many different levels of success criteria and it also defines very much what we want to achieve.\n\n[02:51] Once we imagine that we achieved one of those success criteria, it's fairly easy to move backwards\n\n[02:56] and say what would have needed to be true to get there.\n\n[02:59] And that is actually what turns into the actual roadmap of it later on.\n\n[03:03] Exactly how long this would take to pursue is an interesting question.\n\n[03:07] I would assume a few months. How much it would cost?\n\n[03:10] Well, on its own and not necessarily much, but it's probably a good idea if one could have somebody\n\n[03:14] that actually had it as a job to make sure it actually happens.\n\n[03:18] There are various sketches on how one could go about it.\n\n[03:24] Are there ethical risks with making a roadmap? I would say, yeah, actually there is.\n\n[03:29] There is a risk that you set in stone, the proper approach and any other approach is not the proper one.\n\n[03:34] On the other hand, it's also very useful if you have a decent roadmap to use that to actually set priorities.\n\n[03:42] And maybe even focus on the leverage points by listing what are the big unsolved key problems.\n\n[03:48] If we figure them out or if we do some fail-or-fail approach to that, it will actually help us do it.\n\n[03:54] So this is probably where we need more engagement.\n\n[03:57] As the roadmap starts to take shape, there is going to have to be sending it out to you guys\n\n[04:02] for review and commentary and integrating that and making sure that it's flexible.\n\n[04:06] And presumably, I would assume eventually it would have to become a regular thing that gets updated year by year,\n\n[04:12] like the semiconductor roadmap.\n\n[04:14] So we have been thinking a little bit about the structure.\n\n[04:18] So basically what you want to start out with is some opening about, well, what's brain emulation?\n\n[04:23] Why are we interested? Why should anybody care about it?\n\n[04:27] Then a chapter about defining success criteria.\n\n[04:31] Then you get basically the big chapter that lays out the roadmap.\n\n[04:35] And then after that, the rest of the bulk of the document is going to be a lot of appendices actually going into it.\n\n[04:42] So what about the expansion microscopy with X-rays?\n\n[04:46] What about the different methods that are needed for actually running an emulation data center?\n\n[04:52] What aspects of biochemistry would we need to figure out before we can be able to do that?\n\n[04:58] What are the applications to AGI safety?\n\n[05:01] What are the computer securities and the project security standpoints that might need to?\n\n[05:07] There's probably going to be a lot of stuff here and we're going to find out more as we're working on it.\n\n[05:12] And that's basically that. Have I missed something?\n\n[05:16] No, that's it. And I'm just standing here for moral support.\n\n[05:19] You have been very successful. I feel very supported.\n\n[05:23] Questions, comments, considerations.\n\n[05:32] Super obvious question probably.\n\n[05:38] But like, is there like so many different ways of doing whole brain emulation?\n\n[05:43] How can you have like one roadmap or do you see as like the potential to like integrate it all together into one thing?\n\n[05:50] Yeah, so if it was one Apollo project like thing, I think it would be much easier to make a roadmap.\n\n[05:58] I think what we're having here is that we need to actually have a roadmap that actually consists of several different alternative pathways.\n\n[06:06] Because even on a particular pathway like conic atomic scanning, you still have a bunch of alternative.\n\n[06:13] It's a little bit like the Manhattan Project where they didn't know how to do isotope separation.\n\n[06:17] So they used three pathways in parallel.\n\n[06:20] Here it might be more like we want to map out that there might be these different pathways, see what is needed for them.\n\n[06:26] So just to link into that, I think actually like the real power of like having a roadmap, right, is that it's kind of a rallying cry if there's like a clear outline.\n\n[06:35] And I guess I can see this kind of devolve into, OK, you have six different tracks and then they have different sub roadmaps.\n\n[06:45] And then it's like very hard to disentangle like what the actual plan is for the community to kind of get around and also for funders and politicians.\n\n[06:55] I think it's good criticism, but I think that it's I mean, it's just a fact that we're not at the point where we can do an Intel roadmap, you know, where you basically know what you're going to do.\n\n[07:03] And you're just telling people how fast and what you're exactly how you're engineering it.\n\n[07:08] But but it's a good critique.\n\n[07:10] And that's why the part about making this have an emphasis on what someone would want to fund.\n\n[07:17] So basically that rallying cry part, that's an important change, for example, from the way we looked at the roadmap last year when we were thinking about it, because that really wasn't a major part of it.\n\n[07:28] OK, Patrick.\n\n[07:34] I didn't know if you had a point.\n\n[07:36] OK, sorry, I just thought you were passing the mic.\n\n[07:39] So I guess sort of in response to the last question, I guess I would think that the roadmap would be.\n\n[07:46] And I guess this is some of the statement, but people can feel free to respond.\n\n[07:49] I would think that the roadmap would be more of a more of a set of options and then particular organizations could choose sort of a path on the roadmap to pursue.\n\n[08:00] But it would be more up to that organization to flesh out the ultra specific details of that path.\n\n[08:05] Is that sort of what you guys are thinking?\n\n[08:08] Yeah, we might just need a better word than roadmap.\n\n[08:12] Although I think that's actually a really good description of what a roadmap is.\n\n[08:15] You have a map of the terrain, a bunch of different roads that take you there.\n\n[08:18] Right, right. So I mean, you would.\n\n[08:21] And so I think having a lack of specific roads, like not having just one road is actually good because then, you know, the the the organization can choose a path.\n\n[08:32] But we're just providing the bigger structure of what paths there might be.\n\n[08:38] I'm pointing out the scenic spots and here is a somewhat dangerous part of the road.\n\n[08:45] Right. Construction. Exactly.\n\n[08:49] Yeah, I love this.\n\n[08:52] I'm wondering how you are thinking about incentive structures to create this roadmap because, you know, I think it's been floated maybe in previous workshops that gosh, wouldn't it be great if we had this roadmap.\n\n[09:05] And it seems like a lot of work. Like I imagine that the first roadmap was like 100 pages or so.\n\n[09:12] This one's probably going to be like 300 ish. I imagine. Right.\n\n[09:16] It's consensus. Yeah. Yeah. How are you going to.\n\n[09:20] Yeah, I'm not afraid of very thick text. I love them.\n\n[09:27] Nobody else does.\n\n[09:31] There is actually an important thing here about distilling things down because while I'm very happy with a thousand page set of appendices getting into the deepest details we know today and reviewing every little obscure way of improving the robotic handling of expansion microscopy\n\n[09:47] and the gel cubes. Yeah, maybe the point is the main roadmap sketch and then you want to go as deep as you need. But we need to get that part done well.\n\n[09:58] I think personally that if we make that part really well, and even that appendices never get written in time, we might still actually have something that's darn useful.\n\n[10:07] But I would be much happier if we could motivate every little line in that diagram.\n\n[10:12] Yeah, I think incentive structures are important. And sometimes it's difficult to motivate exactly the people that you would like to have write something or contribute to the roadmap.\n\n[10:21] But it turned out not to be super difficult to get buy in last time around. So we still kind of have on file the yeses from a number of experts who said they would happily contribute to this that we can take as a start anyway.\n\n[10:35] And then some of us are just intrinsically motivated and happy to dig in. So that's useful as well.\n\n[10:41] All right. Thank you guys so much."

        "transcription": "[00:00] Thank you so much again for joining Will.\n\n[00:02] And it's always a pleasure to have you at these workshops.\n\n[00:05] And we're very excited for your talk.\n\n[00:06] Thanks.\n\n[00:07] I'm going to be telling you about our work\n\n[00:09] in crisscross polymerization, led by talented junior\n\n[00:13] investigators.\n\n[00:14] Two of them are here, Chris Wintersinger and Anastasia\n\n[00:17] Irsheva.\n\n[00:19] Third key contributor, Dio Mena, was a former foresight fellow.\n\n[00:22] And then we also have Jie Dong, who just took a faculty\n\n[00:25] position in Wuhan.\n\n[00:26] And I'll be telling you about a reminder of what\n\n[00:28] I talked about last year of building\n\n[00:31] what we call megastructures from building blocks that\n\n[00:34] are DNA origami.\n\n[00:36] And then I'll be sharing very briefly some exciting advances\n\n[00:39] that Anastasia led in trying to get exponential growth\n\n[00:43] from single-stranded slots.\n\n[00:46] And the starting point is thinking about DNA origami.\n\n[00:49] And what I love the most about DNA origami\n\n[00:51] is that you have absolute control\n\n[00:53] over the number of structures that form\n\n[00:56] based on the number of scaffold strands that you add.\n\n[01:00] But what if you wanted to build structures that\n\n[01:02] are far bigger than a scaffold?\n\n[01:06] Because the problem is that with DNA origami, half the mass\n\n[01:09] has to be the scaffold.\n\n[01:10] And so that's the problem we set out to solve.\n\n[01:12] Why would you want to do that?\n\n[01:13] Well, we can envision a future where\n\n[01:15] we can program the self-assembly of squishy robots\n\n[01:18] the size of a cell that might be a million times bigger\n\n[01:22] than an individual DNA origami.\n\n[01:23] We don't have a scaffold half the size of a cell.\n\n[01:27] Contrarily, another point is we would\n\n[01:29] like to be able to build ultra-sensitive enzyme-free\n\n[01:32] diagnostics.\n\n[01:33] We're trying to convert a single analyte\n\n[01:36] into vast polymerization of single-stranded building blocks\n\n[01:39] into double-stranded products.\n\n[01:40] So build a lot of material for amplification.\n\n[01:43] And again, this is something beyond the capability\n\n[01:45] of conventional DNA origami.\n\n[01:48] So I'm going to introduce this concept of crisscross\n\n[01:51] polymerization, where the goal is\n\n[01:52] to program some kind of building block that's\n\n[01:56] thermodynamically specified to assemble into desired shape,\n\n[01:59] but is completely blocked kinetically from ever doing so,\n\n[02:03] except when you add a small seed that is much tinier\n\n[02:06] than the final assembly.\n\n[02:08] And so the basic ingredient is specifications\n\n[02:10] you have a building block through these elongated slats\n\n[02:13] with many specific glues on them.\n\n[02:15] In this case, these are DNA origami slats.\n\n[02:17] Each one of these long things is one DNA origami.\n\n[02:19] It has 32 sequence-specific glues on it.\n\n[02:23] We program them so that they can make interactions\n\n[02:25] with each other at roughly 90 degrees.\n\n[02:28] And it's programmed in the final assembly to have 32 neighbors.\n\n[02:32] But it can only make one contact with any one neighbor.\n\n[02:37] Importantly, we operate this at a temperature\n\n[02:39] where you need close to half of the bonds, or 16 in this case,\n\n[02:43] for stable assembly.\n\n[02:44] So if you only made eight bonds or nine bonds,\n\n[02:47] it'll transiently come together.\n\n[02:49] And then it'll fall apart.\n\n[02:51] And that's really the key of designing a process that\n\n[02:54] will never ever start kinetically,\n\n[02:56] even though it's favored thermodynamically.\n\n[02:58] So we can imagine a growth trajectory where we have two\n\n[03:00] slats come together.\n\n[03:01] The energy deficit is represented.\n\n[03:03] One represents the cost.\n\n[03:04] One unit is the cost of fixing one of those building blocks\n\n[03:08] into exactly the right position entropically.\n\n[03:11] And so just bringing two things together,\n\n[03:12] it's making only one bond.\n\n[03:14] Well, that's not favored.\n\n[03:15] So that's very unstable.\n\n[03:18] But what's even more unstable is trying to add two more slats.\n\n[03:21] Because every time you add another slat,\n\n[03:22] you're making fewer than those 16 bonds.\n\n[03:24] So you're just writing up the energy landscape,\n\n[03:28] climbing Mount Improbable, you might call it,\n\n[03:31] to make successively more preposterously unlikely\n\n[03:34] structures.\n\n[03:35] Until you finally get to this structure\n\n[03:37] we call the critical nucleus, where finally once you achieve\n\n[03:39] this mountain peak, you can start adding building blocks\n\n[03:42] where each added building block is making 16 bonds\n\n[03:45] and therefore is stable.\n\n[03:47] But the situation is to get to this peak,\n\n[03:49] we need to climb an energy barrier of 16 units.\n\n[03:53] In other words, the entropic price of fixing 16 building\n\n[03:56] blocks in exactly the right orientation\n\n[03:58] without anything to hold them together.\n\n[04:00] Which will basically, you could fill the ocean with these things\n\n[04:02] and then wait the age of the universe.\n\n[04:04] It's just not going to happen as long as you're\n\n[04:05] close to that reversible temperature.\n\n[04:07] And then that will buy us the opportunity\n\n[04:09] to control this process by putting in a little deus\n\n[04:13] ecmakina, a single denier origami seed that's\n\n[04:15] using very strong bonds to position those first 16\n\n[04:19] horizontal structures.\n\n[04:21] It pays that entropic price and now the process\n\n[04:23] can go off and running, where we can imagine starting\n\n[04:26] with this bidirectional growth front,\n\n[04:28] we're adding 16 slats at a time, and then we\n\n[04:31] can towel around into some desired structure.\n\n[04:34] And so we can see a transmission electron micrograph here\n\n[04:36] of an object approaching a micrometer in scale\n\n[04:39] with 192 origami.\n\n[04:41] We published this work in Nature and Nanotechnology\n\n[04:43] and the station designed this beautiful cover.\n\n[04:46] So these structures are made from over 1,000 denier origami.\n\n[04:50] Each are different.\n\n[04:51] Overall dimensions of two microns by two microns.\n\n[04:55] And right now we're working on trying\n\n[04:57] to extend this to make it in more order magnitude bigger,\n\n[05:00] or maybe two orders magnitude bigger, try to make 3D.\n\n[05:02] I don't have time to go into those details right now.\n\n[05:04] Happy to talk about it later.\n\n[05:06] I just want to briefly point out I stuck this\n\n[05:08] into one of the working documents,\n\n[05:09] this idea of how to use crisscross for implosion.\n\n[05:12] So I'm not really going to talk about it here.\n\n[05:14] I'm just going to briefly mention that the point of this\n\n[05:17] is that it's how do you build pre-assembled three\n\n[05:20] to five nanometer building blocks into much bigger\n\n[05:22] structures if that's what you want.\n\n[05:24] This is agnostic about how you make those smaller building\n\n[05:26] blocks.\n\n[05:27] It's really about that next step.\n\n[05:29] And so now I'd like to briefly talk about crisscross\n\n[05:32] with single-stranded building blocks\n\n[05:33] for the purpose of signal amplification for diagnostics.\n\n[05:38] And you can repeat this crisscross process\n\n[05:41] with the same advantages of kinetic blockade,\n\n[05:43] but with now tiny, tiny building blocks that\n\n[05:45] are just oligonucleotides.\n\n[05:47] And the oligonucleotides are just binding to each other\n\n[05:49] with half a turn.\n\n[05:51] That's one binding site.\n\n[05:52] And the same process where you specify that at equilibrium,\n\n[05:56] all the binding sites are occupied\n\n[05:57] by a bunch of different binding partners,\n\n[06:01] but that kinetically it never gets off the starting point\n\n[06:04] because of this entropic barrier.\n\n[06:06] So you're writing up this climbing non-improbable,\n\n[06:09] and it's so rare to get to the peak\n\n[06:10] that this process basically never happens.\n\n[06:13] But now we have single-stranded building blocks,\n\n[06:14] so the assembly can happen much more quickly.\n\n[06:16] We have these building blocks at very high concentration.\n\n[06:19] And again, if we introduce a seed that somehow\n\n[06:21] is linked to the analyte that we're trying to detect,\n\n[06:23] in this case, Sedinia ergami, then we\n\n[06:25] can trigger the process in a controlled fashion.\n\n[06:27] So it nucleates the assembly, and then it grows.\n\n[06:30] We have ideas of how to convert any analyte into such a seed.\n\n[06:34] Happy to talk about it later.\n\n[06:36] And really, the brand new idea that Anastasia\n\n[06:39] has been developing that we're very excited about\n\n[06:41] is how do we actually get this to grow not just linearly,\n\n[06:45] but exponentially?\n\n[06:46] It turns out linear growth is too slow in order\n\n[06:48] to get truly in-fold amplification.\n\n[06:50] And so the scheme, we came up with a strand displacement\n\n[06:53] based scheme in order to cut these thick filaments.\n\n[06:55] And that might sound very difficult,\n\n[06:57] but we figured out a scheme that works.\n\n[07:00] And it's based on this notion of toe-hole mediated strand\n\n[07:02] displacement that many of you might be familiar with,\n\n[07:04] that you can think of this as how do we\n\n[07:06] break the blue and the black strands apart?\n\n[07:09] That's kind of cutting this into two pieces.\n\n[07:11] And the way that we do this is by introducing\n\n[07:14] a single-stranded toe-hold that the displacing strand can\n\n[07:16] grab onto to nucleate, undergo branch migration,\n\n[07:19] and kick the black off.\n\n[07:20] This is how we split the blue and black into two strands.\n\n[07:24] And then in this case, in the middle,\n\n[07:26] is taking this analogy with one of our crisscross structures.\n\n[07:29] So here we're asking the green strand in this middle thing\n\n[07:33] to come in and displace the top slot away.\n\n[07:36] And so it kind of comes in.\n\n[07:37] And I'm not going to describe this in great detail,\n\n[07:40] but hopefully you can kind of see\n\n[07:42] the analogy between the middle and the top.\n\n[07:44] I'll have you talk about it later.\n\n[07:45] And then here's kind of the mind bender,\n\n[07:48] is we can extend the process to now involve\n\n[07:50] coordinated strand displacement by a set of these invader\n\n[07:53] strands that coordinate in a way to basically separate\n\n[07:57] the bottom block from the northeast block.\n\n[08:00] And in that way, we can have coordinated attack\n\n[08:02] by many invader strands and then split this very thick object\n\n[08:06] into two.\n\n[08:07] And then we can incorporate that into our crisscross growth\n\n[08:10] model where we're making these linear ribbons.\n\n[08:13] We introduce these coordinated toeholds\n\n[08:15] so you have a bunch of invader strands\n\n[08:16] that can eat in from the north and from the east.\n\n[08:20] And if you have invasion on two fronts,\n\n[08:22] then you can basically get this thing to split\n\n[08:24] in a stage of midnight animation showing this process.\n\n[08:28] Again, you can download it from the Google Doc\n\n[08:31] if you want to look at this in more detail.\n\n[08:34] And in that way, we can get exponential amplification.\n\n[08:39] And it kind of works,\n\n[08:41] but we're still trying to improve on its performance.\n\n[08:44] The latest is we have some kind of variant where we can get\n\n[08:46] down to subatomol or limited detection,\n\n[08:48] which we're very excited about.\n\n[08:49] So in summary, this is a scheme with\n\n[08:51] the single-stranded building blocks that we think will be\n\n[08:53] extremely useful for enzyme-free,\n\n[08:55] ultra-sensitive detection of things like pathogens,\n\n[08:58] especially in the developing world.\n\n[09:00] And I'll conclude by just reminding again\n\n[09:03] that here specifically we're looking at how do we\n\n[09:05] implement exponential conversion of\n\n[09:07] single-stranded building blocks into\n\n[09:09] double-stranded products for the purpose of diagnostics.\n\n[09:12] But on another scale, we're longitudinally interested,\n\n[09:14] how do we advance the field of\n\n[09:16] biomelecular nanotechnology to sustain\n\n[09:19] an exponential trend in the maximum complexity\n\n[09:22] of the structures that we can construct over time.\n\n[09:25] And then another thing I'd just like to point out is that\n\n[09:27] nothing in our crisscross cartoons\n\n[09:29] has anything to do with DNA.\n\n[09:30] We implemented this single-stranded DNA.\n\n[09:33] We implemented with DNA origami building blocks.\n\n[09:36] We challenge people in the community to\n\n[09:38] repeat this algorithm with other materials such as\n\n[09:40] proteins or maybe non-biological polymers as well.\n\n[09:43] So, thanks.\n\n[09:44] Interesting. Thank you.\n\n[09:48] Okay. We have time for one question.\n\n[09:54] Really, really simple question,\n\n[09:56] particularly related to the last point.\n\n[09:58] So, how does one of your deficit units compare to KT?\n\n[10:02] So, you had your energy deficit units,\n\n[10:06] how do they compare to KT?\n\n[10:08] Yeah. So, if you imagine, let's say your building blocks\n\n[10:10] were at one micromolar concentration,\n\n[10:13] and then the effective concentration within the ribbon,\n\n[10:16] let's just say for argument's sake it's one molar.\n\n[10:18] So, that's a six order of magnitude concentration to\n\n[10:22] pull it out of micromolar bulk solution into the ribbon.\n\n[10:26] So, each order of magnitude corresponds to 2.3 KT.\n\n[10:30] So, in the case of the origami,\n\n[10:33] there's 16 units,\n\n[10:36] 16 times 2.3 is like 38 KT.\n\n[10:39] That's huge. That's like two ATP's worth of energy.\n\n[10:42] It's never going to happen. It's not going to happen.\n\n[10:47] So, how do you think that\n\n[10:49] your work could fit into their respective architecture?\n\n[10:52] Yeah. So, I have this figure that I embedded in the work,\n\n[10:55] the workpiece and also it's here.\n\n[10:58] You can download it.\n\n[10:59] So, again, this is a scheme for making\n\n[11:02] an exploded view of pre-assembled 3-5 nanometer building blocks\n\n[11:07] that each would fit on the node on the crisscross grid.\n\n[11:11] Then the advantage here is that you could\n\n[11:14] hierarchically construct each slot with,\n\n[11:17] let's say, 32 guests on it.\n\n[11:18] So, first you have some kind of mechanism,\n\n[11:20] your first level printer makes\n\n[11:22] your 3-5 nanometer building blocks.\n\n[11:24] Then your second level process fabricates the slats\n\n[11:27] with 32 of them loaded up in a linear fashion.\n\n[11:30] This is the third step where we now assemble\n\n[11:34] those 32 subunits together into\n\n[11:36] a much bigger structure in an exploded view.\n\n[11:39] Then we can also do funny,\n\n[11:40] we have more access in this exploded view.\n\n[11:42] Then when we're ready, we could program it to\n\n[11:45] compact along the y-axis.\n\n[11:47] So, this is just like a little grid structure.\n\n[11:49] Hopefully, we've all seen these kind of\n\n[11:51] the boxing glove thing that expands and contracts.\n\n[11:53] So, contract in the y-axis.\n\n[11:56] Then what we do is we remove the DNA scaffold and we've\n\n[11:59] also inserted some rubber bands along the orthogonal axis.\n\n[12:04] So, in the second step, we can take the structure that's only\n\n[12:06] cross-linked along the y-axis and then we\n\n[12:10] can compact it along the x-axis as well.\n\n[12:13] It's probably confusing, but happy to talk about it more later.\n\n[12:16] Wonderful. Thank you so much, Will."

        "transcription": "[00:00] And now without further ado, the final presentation in the morning session, we'll have Julian Engel. Thank you so much for joining us.\n\n[00:05] Hey, so I'm Julian, co-founder and CEO of AdaptiveBio. We're a protein engineering company, and I apologize for the title of the talk, which makes it sound like we are building a protein printer.\n\n[00:15] So there's two things. I'm running a protein engineering startup. We're thinking hard about how to make protein engineering easier for people so that you can use these great machine learning models to design new proteins, get them tested in real life.\n\n[00:26] And then we were brainstorming about some interesting concept for how to make DNA cheaper, and that resulted in this idea for a protein printer. So I'll go through both of them real quick.\n\n[00:35] AdaptiveBio, we're convinced proteins are nature's nanotechnology. We can do so many cool things with them in our bodies. They modify DNA, transport cargo around, defend our body against infections, and produce energy, transduce these photons hitting our retina into signals for our brain.\n\n[00:53] All of these cool things. And right now we just suck at protein engineering. So our mission is basically to turn protein engineering labs from looking like this into something that looks like this, and from making the job of the protein engineer from doing this to doing something like this.\n\n[01:08] And in order to do so, we're trying to build a full stack protein engineering foundry that integrates everything from the synthetic biology to DNA design, assembly, protein synthesis, protein testing, doing that then in an automated fashion on lab equipment, integrating the data from all of this, and exposing that to users via an easy to use software interface or an API so that you can just design proteins from your computer, send the designs to the lab, get them tested, get the functional data back, and iterate this way.\n\n[01:38] And a couple of mock ups of what we'll have coming up basically just like web interface where you can see all your experiments for your proteins, your projects, and you can then basically design a new experiment, run it on the platform, get the data back as soon as the experiment is finished, and iterate this way.\n\n[01:54] So that's what we're doing with adaptive. And if you look through like a simple protein engineering experiment from protein design to building the DNA, to building the protein, to testing the protein, and we take something like just using an AI model like RF diffusion, what Alexey introduced in the beginning, for example, state of the art, open source protein design model, getting a DNA fragment from someone like Twist, DNA synthesis vendor, and then we can actually\n\n[02:24] and then making the protein using self-reexpression and then testing the protein for binding. If you just look at the costs associated with that, right now the cost for DNA exceeds all the other costs by like a factor of 10x or something.\n\n[02:36] And that was always something that we were thinking about. And then one night in cold Switzerland last winter, we were brainstorming, we were thinking, okay, what if, so we come to a conclusion that DNA is still way too expensive, hasn't dropped much in the last five years or so.\n\n[02:53] If you look at these calls and curves, they're still stuck at something like five cents per base pair for DNA synthesis costs. So if you order this gene at Twist, you have to pay 50 bucks, although the other steps in the process are not that expensive.\n\n[03:05] So what if you could make a protein without having to use DNA? We have the central dogma of molecular biology. DNA gets transcribed into RNA. The RNA gets translated into protein.\n\n[03:17] The protein actually is much smaller than the RNA. There's a great book on that. Biology by the numbers, recommend checking out. What if we could just skip the DNA part and directly encode somehow the functionality of the amino acids into some sort of protein printer and then make the protein from that.\n\n[03:36] And that got us brainstorming. And then in the end, co wrote something with Nico McCarthy who runs this synthetic biology sub stack called code on. And that's what I'm going to go through quickly here. Now present this as if this was a working like molecular machine.\n\n[03:52] And then in the end, we can find all the mistakes that are in there because they are tons in there. So, okay, we know about the ribosome. We know it translates basically the mRNA into protein.\n\n[04:02] And now if you want to get rid of the DNA of the mRNA, we basically have to encode all of those signals for the different amino acids somehow into some sort of pattern that we can direct the ribosome to do.\n\n[04:13] And with something like 20 amino acids, you need at least five bits basically in order to do that and five bits with, for example, some optogenetic signal.\n\n[04:22] If you imagine the ribosome changing and then incorporating a different amino acid, that's already like crazy molecular engineering that no one can do right now.\n\n[04:29] So at this point, we were thinking, okay, what if you you have already all these like encoding agents, basically the tRNAs. What if you just kept them?\n\n[04:38] You put them all in like a ring and then you basically dial up the tRNA that you actually want to have or the code and that you want to have. Here's the original sketch for that. That makes it much clearer.\n\n[04:47] Basically imagine like a rotary phone where you dial up the codon that you want to actually use and then you can go back and forth maybe or you just go in a circle and you reset and then you put in.\n\n[04:57] Then you have like a signal that says, okay, now incorporate, please, whatever codon is there. And then the ribosome will produce that protein.\n\n[05:04] Okay, here is a bit more cleaned up. We just assume we have two signals, blue light, red light. The blue light opens up some sort of gate on the A side of the ribosome, which now allows the tRNA to bring the amino acid for whatever codon we're currently at.\n\n[05:22] And then with the red light, we're going to move the ribosome along this like rotary codon stretch to whatever codon we want.\n\n[05:30] And if we then put it like this, we can make our encoding scheme for whatever protein we want to synthesize.\n\n[05:39] We have our two signals. We have a rotary dial. We have a dial up table. And then if we want to start with methionine, okay, we just incorporate.\n\n[05:48] Then for alanine, we move one codon we incorporate. For speragine, we have to move three or three codons and then we incorporate and so on.\n\n[05:58] And we move along this table. And if we have to go basically one codon back, we cannot go back. So we just go like around the entire table and we have 20 red signals and then one blue one.\n\n[06:09] But it would work. Maybe, you know, it's kind of hard. Like I said, we're going to get to all the problems that are in there.\n\n[06:16] But basically, that was the idea. Like digitally encode proteins without having to use DNA.\n\n[06:21] And then you could put this basically into a miniaturized protein synthesizer where you just have a grid of programmable LEDs.\n\n[06:29] They can be very small. If you look at the OLED feature sizes that we have currently, then a grid of these rotary ribosomes where we immobilize them.\n\n[06:37] And then underneath a grid of microwelds where we can do actual functional protein testing.\n\n[06:42] And then in something like a box smaller than a smartphone, we could basically produce like millions of potentially billions of proteins in parallel and test them for their function and iterate quickly towards new protein designs.\n\n[06:53] So there was the whole basically speculative exercise of designing this protein printer. And I don't have a good idea of the time right now. Could you tell me how much?\n\n[07:02] Twenty seconds. Perfect. Then I'll stop here and we can move over to the Q&A next. I have a summary slide.\n\n[07:08] I have a summary slide. OK, so basically, it's a protein engineering foundry with adaptive.\n\n[07:12] We try to make it easy for you to order a protein to be tested. And then this is with code on newsletter, just like speculative protein printer that gets rid of DNA and basically kills twists business model.\n\n[07:25] OK, wonderful. Thank you.\n\n[07:32] We have time for one or two questions before I ask you the discussion prompt.\n\n[07:37] It just seems to be very susceptible to slipping by one errors. What do you do about that?\n\n[07:43] Yeah, no idea. Basically, in order to have any significant quantity of protein to test to pick up with like common protein assay methods, you have to have like a million of protein or so.\n\n[07:54] So basically you have to imagine, OK, I have a million ribosomes and they probably get out of sync. And then there's lots of problems with that.\n\n[08:02] One more question. Sorry.\n\n[08:07] Maybe single molecule detection could work for this, but yeah, it's a very clear idea. I was just wondering what's the photo responsive unit here in your design?\n\n[08:16] What's the actual component that respond to either blue or red light? Yeah, so that would be a light sensitive protein. I mean, they're photosensitive switches.\n\n[08:25] So I think the actual the the blue light protein basically that could basically a bit easier.\n\n[08:32] You have a protein which just has a mechanical deformation upon registering this photon of a certain wavelength.\n\n[08:38] And that basically blocks the side. But then this probably has some refractory period where it just like resets after a while and then something else could incorporate.\n\n[08:46] So this requires first better protein engineering of the building blocks so that you can then put together this more complicated machine.\n\n[08:54] Maybe if I can ask another one, how would you achieve unit rationality here?\n\n[08:57] Because it looks like your design relies in the whole thing always moving in the same direction.\n\n[09:03] But how would you make sure that that actually happens in the machine? Directionality as in forward and backward? Yeah.\n\n[09:10] Yeah, you don't need that. You can just move forward by one codon at a time.\n\n[09:14] How do you know it will always move forward? Well, I mean, that depends on the type of motor protein.\n\n[09:20] For example, if you have like a nanopore that unwinds DNA for DNA sequencing with nanopore sequencers, like it only moves the DNA in one direction.\n\n[09:28] So I think that's fairly established, although no one has ever put this together in such a machine.\n\n[09:34] Right. So then the question from us is, again, if you look at the other architectures, it's not in anywhere. Is it a new proposal?\n\n[09:42] I don't think it's a it's a new new proposal or something.\n\n[09:44] We're just trying to basically build something functional for basic building blocks so that you could even go ahead and design a new let's say reagent nanobody reagent antibodies are like a 10 billion market by itself.\n\n[09:56] Use them all over the world. But right now, if you have our diffusion, like a machine learning model, you cannot easily design something that you could sell on the market to advance protein engineering.\n\n[10:04] So that's kind of like the low level stuff that we're doing with the startup.\n\n[10:07] And this as like a more complex thing to put together different building blocks just serves as like inspiration for more protein engineers and molecular engineers to maybe get into the field to start using those tools."

        "transcription": "[00:00] This video is based on an article by Max Rosa at Our World in Data.\n\n[00:06] Ourworldindata.org is a website providing open access research and data to make progress against the world's largest problems.\n\n[00:14] The world is awful.\n\n[00:17] The world is much better than it was.\n\n[00:20] The world can be much better than it is.\n\n[00:23] All three statements are true at the same time.\n\n[00:27] It's wrong to think that these three statements contradict each other.\n\n[00:30] We need to see that they are all true to see that a better world is possible.\n\n[00:35] Discussions about the state of the world too often focus on the first statement.\n\n[00:40] The news highlights what's going wrong, rarely mentioning any positive development.\n\n[00:45] A pushback on this narrative takes it to the other extreme, which is equally damaging.\n\n[00:50] Solely communicating the progress that the world has achieved becomes unhelpful or even repugnant when it glosses over the problems that are real today.\n\n[00:59] It's hard to resist falling for only one of these perspectives.\n\n[01:03] But to see that a better world is possible, we need to see that both are true at the same time.\n\n[01:08] The world is awful, and the world is much better than it was.\n\n[01:12] To illustrate what I mean, I'll use the example of one of humanity's biggest tragedies, the death of its children.\n\n[01:19] But the same is true for many of the world's other problems.\n\n[01:22] Humanity faces many problems where things have improved over time, which are still terrible and for which we know that things can get better.\n\n[01:31] The world is awful.\n\n[01:33] Globally, 4.3% of children die before they're 15 years old.\n\n[01:39] This is the data for 2020, the latest available year.\n\n[01:43] This means that 5.9 million children die every year.\n\n[01:47] 16,000 children on any average day, or 11 children every minute.\n\n[01:53] Clearly, a world where thousands of tragedies happen every single day is awful.\n\n[02:00] The world is much better than it was.\n\n[02:03] History's big lesson is that things change.\n\n[02:07] But it's hard to imagine how dire living conditions once were, and that makes it difficult to grasp just how much the world has changed.\n\n[02:15] Perhaps looking at the data can help us get our head around the scale of the change.\n\n[02:20] Historians estimate that in the past, around half of all children died before they reached the end of puberty.\n\n[02:27] This was true no matter where in the world a child was born, and it only started to change in the 19th century, just a few generations ago.\n\n[02:35] It's hard to imagine, but child mortality in the very worst off places today is much better than anywhere in the past.\n\n[02:43] Even in the world's richest countries, the mortality of children was much higher very recently.\n\n[02:49] In Somalia, the country with the highest mortality today, around 14% of all children die.\n\n[02:55] Just a few generations ago, the mortality rate was more than three times as high, even in the best off places.\n\n[03:02] What we learn from our history is that it's possible to change the world.\n\n[03:07] Unfortunately, long-run data on how living conditions have changed is rarely studied in school and rarely reported in the media.\n\n[03:15] As a result, many people are entirely unaware of even the most fundamental positive developments in the world.\n\n[03:21] But this fact, that it is possible to change the world and achieve extraordinary progress for entire societies, is something that everyone should know.\n\n[03:31] The world can be much better than it is.\n\n[03:35] Progress over time shows that it was possible to change the world in the past.\n\n[03:40] But do we know that it's possible to continue this progress into the future?\n\n[03:44] Or were we perhaps born at that unlucky moment in history at which progress has come to a halt?\n\n[03:50] Studying the global data suggests that the answer is no.\n\n[03:54] One way to see this is to look at the places in the world with the highest living conditions today.\n\n[03:59] The best off places show that extremely low child mortality is not just a possibility, but is already a reality.\n\n[04:07] The world region where children have the best chance of surviving childhood is the European Union.\n\n[04:12] 99.55% of all children born in the EU survive childhood.\n\n[04:18] To see how much better the world can be, we can ask what the world would look like if this became the reality everywhere.\n\n[04:25] What if children around the world would be as well off as children in the EU?\n\n[04:30] 5 million fewer children would die every year.\n\n[04:33] Of course, the child mortality rate in the EU is still too high, and there's no reason that progress should stop there.\n\n[04:40] Cancers like leukemia and brain tumors kill hundreds of children, even in today's richest countries.\n\n[04:46] We should strive to find ways to prevent these tragic deaths.\n\n[04:50] However, the largest opportunities to prevent the pain and suffering of children are in the poorer countries.\n\n[04:56] There we know not only that things can be better, but how to make them better.\n\n[05:01] You can use this research on how to make the world a better place to contribute to this progress yourself.\n\n[05:07] I recommend relying on research published by the non-profit organization GiveWell.org.\n\n[05:12] GiveWell's team spent years identifying the most cost-effective charities,\n\n[05:16] so that your donation can have the biggest positive impact on the lives of others.\n\n[05:20] Several of the recommended charities focus on improving the health of children,\n\n[05:24] offering you the opportunity to contribute to the progress against child mortality.\n\n[05:29] Research on how to prevent child deaths and the fact that child mortality in entire world regions is tenfold lower than the global average show what is possible.\n\n[05:39] Millions of child deaths are preventable.\n\n[05:42] We know that it is possible to make the world a better place.\n\n[05:47] The world is awful. This is why we need to know about progress.\n\n[05:51] The news often focuses on how awful the world is.\n\n[05:55] There's a large audience for bad news, and it's easier to scare people than to encourage them to achieve positive change.\n\n[06:02] I agree that it is important that we know what's wrong with the world.\n\n[06:06] But given the scale of what we've achieved already and of what's possible in the future,\n\n[06:10] I think it's irresponsible to only report on how awful our situation is.\n\n[06:15] To see that the world has become a better place does not mean to deny that we are facing very serious problems.\n\n[06:21] To the contrary, if we had achieved the best of all possible worlds, I wouldn't spend my life writing and researching about how we got here.\n\n[06:28] It is because the world is still terrible that it is so important to see how the world became so much better than it was.\n\n[06:35] I wish we could change our culture so that we take this possibility of progress more seriously.\n\n[06:41] This is a solvable problem. We have the data and the research, but we are currently not using it.\n\n[06:47] The data is often stored in inaccessible databases, the research locked away behind paywalls and buried under jargon in academic papers.\n\n[06:56] With our world in data, we want to change this.\n\n[06:59] If we want more people to dedicate their energy and money to making the world a better place,\n\n[07:05] then we should make it much more widely known that it is possible to make the world a better place."

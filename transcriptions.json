        "transcription": "[00:00] Okay, so one of these presentations isn't like others because we're not actually trying to solve the problem per se.\n\n[00:08] We're talking about the meta about how to write about how we're trying to solve these problems.\n\n[00:13] So here we are talking about the roadmap project.\n\n[00:20] This is what Chatjipati thinks it should look like.\n\n[00:24] It still can't spell, but at least it looks very impressive.\n\n[00:28] So I think in many ways it's kind of obvious what this is all about.\n\n[00:36] There is the old roadmap. I think it's influenced a lot of us. It's been fairly useful.\n\n[00:42] Everybody's been going on for ages that we ought to do an update because stuff has happened.\n\n[00:48] And we should be trying to do that. Why should we do it?\n\n[00:52] Well, partially for our own sake. We actually might want to have a way of organizing our thoughts.\n\n[00:58] There have been a lot of really clever ideas coming up over the past hours, for example.\n\n[01:04] But we need to organize this in a better way. We need to have some common frames of reference.\n\n[01:10] It's also very useful for getting funders interested or getting companies interested.\n\n[01:15] Eventually, when we start talking to policymakers and the public about it,\n\n[01:19] we need to have something to point to that is a bit solid.\n\n[01:23] There are various papers like Randall's Success Criteria paper and other reviews of various particular methodologies\n\n[01:33] that obviously have moved things forward, but it might be nice to integrate it.\n\n[01:38] Now to the practical part, how do you actually write a roadmap?\n\n[01:43] The first one was more or less done by me. That was a small project.\n\n[01:48] But now it's getting bigger and we also need to get info from a lot more people.\n\n[01:52] So it's pretty clear that we want to have probably at least two leads.\n\n[01:56] Simply because if one drops the ball, the others can start saying, hey, what is going on?\n\n[02:02] Randall has chosen to be involved here. I don't know whether you're the general of this or so.\n\n[02:09] But at least I'm happy to point that I'm happy to be involved.\n\n[02:13] We should probably figure out a better organization for that.\n\n[02:16] And then once you have leads, then we want to get the new technical details in, add some of the new discussions.\n\n[02:25] When you think about what is the main bottleneck for success besides that we might still not write things,\n\n[02:32] I think part of it is defining the success criteria, because that is actually a key kind of almost philosophical thing\n\n[02:40] that is actually non-trivial, as we have been finding over the past few days.\n\n[02:45] There are many different levels of success criteria and it also defines very much what we want to achieve.\n\n[02:51] Once we imagine that we achieved one of those success criteria, it's fairly easy to move backwards\n\n[02:56] and say what would have needed to be true to get there.\n\n[02:59] And that is actually what turns into the actual roadmap of it later on.\n\n[03:03] Exactly how long this would take to pursue is an interesting question.\n\n[03:07] I would assume a few months. How much it would cost?\n\n[03:10] Well, on its own and not necessarily much, but it's probably a good idea if one could have somebody\n\n[03:14] that actually had it as a job to make sure it actually happens.\n\n[03:18] There are various sketches on how one could go about it.\n\n[03:24] Are there ethical risks with making a roadmap? I would say, yeah, actually there is.\n\n[03:29] There is a risk that you set in stone, the proper approach and any other approach is not the proper one.\n\n[03:34] On the other hand, it's also very useful if you have a decent roadmap to use that to actually set priorities.\n\n[03:42] And maybe even focus on the leverage points by listing what are the big unsolved key problems.\n\n[03:48] If we figure them out or if we do some fail-or-fail approach to that, it will actually help us do it.\n\n[03:54] So this is probably where we need more engagement.\n\n[03:57] As the roadmap starts to take shape, there is going to have to be sending it out to you guys\n\n[04:02] for review and commentary and integrating that and making sure that it's flexible.\n\n[04:06] And presumably, I would assume eventually it would have to become a regular thing that gets updated year by year,\n\n[04:12] like the semiconductor roadmap.\n\n[04:14] So we have been thinking a little bit about the structure.\n\n[04:18] So basically what you want to start out with is some opening about, well, what's brain emulation?\n\n[04:23] Why are we interested? Why should anybody care about it?\n\n[04:27] Then a chapter about defining success criteria.\n\n[04:31] Then you get basically the big chapter that lays out the roadmap.\n\n[04:35] And then after that, the rest of the bulk of the document is going to be a lot of appendices actually going into it.\n\n[04:42] So what about the expansion microscopy with X-rays?\n\n[04:46] What about the different methods that are needed for actually running an emulation data center?\n\n[04:52] What aspects of biochemistry would we need to figure out before we can be able to do that?\n\n[04:58] What are the applications to AGI safety?\n\n[05:01] What are the computer securities and the project security standpoints that might need to?\n\n[05:07] There's probably going to be a lot of stuff here and we're going to find out more as we're working on it.\n\n[05:12] And that's basically that. Have I missed something?\n\n[05:16] No, that's it. And I'm just standing here for moral support.\n\n[05:19] You have been very successful. I feel very supported.\n\n[05:23] Questions, comments, considerations.\n\n[05:32] Super obvious question probably.\n\n[05:38] But like, is there like so many different ways of doing whole brain emulation?\n\n[05:43] How can you have like one roadmap or do you see as like the potential to like integrate it all together into one thing?\n\n[05:50] Yeah, so if it was one Apollo project like thing, I think it would be much easier to make a roadmap.\n\n[05:58] I think what we're having here is that we need to actually have a roadmap that actually consists of several different alternative pathways.\n\n[06:06] Because even on a particular pathway like conic atomic scanning, you still have a bunch of alternative.\n\n[06:13] It's a little bit like the Manhattan Project where they didn't know how to do isotope separation.\n\n[06:17] So they used three pathways in parallel.\n\n[06:20] Here it might be more like we want to map out that there might be these different pathways, see what is needed for them.\n\n[06:26] So just to link into that, I think actually like the real power of like having a roadmap, right, is that it's kind of a rallying cry if there's like a clear outline.\n\n[06:35] And I guess I can see this kind of devolve into, OK, you have six different tracks and then they have different sub roadmaps.\n\n[06:45] And then it's like very hard to disentangle like what the actual plan is for the community to kind of get around and also for funders and politicians.\n\n[06:55] I think it's good criticism, but I think that it's I mean, it's just a fact that we're not at the point where we can do an Intel roadmap, you know, where you basically know what you're going to do.\n\n[07:03] And you're just telling people how fast and what you're exactly how you're engineering it.\n\n[07:08] But but it's a good critique.\n\n[07:10] And that's why the part about making this have an emphasis on what someone would want to fund.\n\n[07:17] So basically that rallying cry part, that's an important change, for example, from the way we looked at the roadmap last year when we were thinking about it, because that really wasn't a major part of it.\n\n[07:28] OK, Patrick.\n\n[07:34] I didn't know if you had a point.\n\n[07:36] OK, sorry, I just thought you were passing the mic.\n\n[07:39] So I guess sort of in response to the last question, I guess I would think that the roadmap would be.\n\n[07:46] And I guess this is some of the statement, but people can feel free to respond.\n\n[07:49] I would think that the roadmap would be more of a more of a set of options and then particular organizations could choose sort of a path on the roadmap to pursue.\n\n[08:00] But it would be more up to that organization to flesh out the ultra specific details of that path.\n\n[08:05] Is that sort of what you guys are thinking?\n\n[08:08] Yeah, we might just need a better word than roadmap.\n\n[08:12] Although I think that's actually a really good description of what a roadmap is.\n\n[08:15] You have a map of the terrain, a bunch of different roads that take you there.\n\n[08:18] Right, right. So I mean, you would.\n\n[08:21] And so I think having a lack of specific roads, like not having just one road is actually good because then, you know, the the the organization can choose a path.\n\n[08:32] But we're just providing the bigger structure of what paths there might be.\n\n[08:38] I'm pointing out the scenic spots and here is a somewhat dangerous part of the road.\n\n[08:45] Right. Construction. Exactly.\n\n[08:49] Yeah, I love this.\n\n[08:52] I'm wondering how you are thinking about incentive structures to create this roadmap because, you know, I think it's been floated maybe in previous workshops that gosh, wouldn't it be great if we had this roadmap.\n\n[09:05] And it seems like a lot of work. Like I imagine that the first roadmap was like 100 pages or so.\n\n[09:12] This one's probably going to be like 300 ish. I imagine. Right.\n\n[09:16] It's consensus. Yeah. Yeah. How are you going to.\n\n[09:20] Yeah, I'm not afraid of very thick text. I love them.\n\n[09:27] Nobody else does.\n\n[09:31] There is actually an important thing here about distilling things down because while I'm very happy with a thousand page set of appendices getting into the deepest details we know today and reviewing every little obscure way of improving the robotic handling of expansion microscopy\n\n[09:47] and the gel cubes. Yeah, maybe the point is the main roadmap sketch and then you want to go as deep as you need. But we need to get that part done well.\n\n[09:58] I think personally that if we make that part really well, and even that appendices never get written in time, we might still actually have something that's darn useful.\n\n[10:07] But I would be much happier if we could motivate every little line in that diagram.\n\n[10:12] Yeah, I think incentive structures are important. And sometimes it's difficult to motivate exactly the people that you would like to have write something or contribute to the roadmap.\n\n[10:21] But it turned out not to be super difficult to get buy in last time around. So we still kind of have on file the yeses from a number of experts who said they would happily contribute to this that we can take as a start anyway.\n\n[10:35] And then some of us are just intrinsically motivated and happy to dig in. So that's useful as well.\n\n[10:41] All right. Thank you guys so much."

        "transcription": "[00:00] Thank you so much again for joining Will.\n\n[00:02] And it's always a pleasure to have you at these workshops.\n\n[00:05] And we're very excited for your talk.\n\n[00:06] Thanks.\n\n[00:07] I'm going to be telling you about our work\n\n[00:09] in crisscross polymerization, led by talented junior\n\n[00:13] investigators.\n\n[00:14] Two of them are here, Chris Wintersinger and Anastasia\n\n[00:17] Irsheva.\n\n[00:19] Third key contributor, Dio Mena, was a former foresight fellow.\n\n[00:22] And then we also have Jie Dong, who just took a faculty\n\n[00:25] position in Wuhan.\n\n[00:26] And I'll be telling you about a reminder of what\n\n[00:28] I talked about last year of building\n\n[00:31] what we call megastructures from building blocks that\n\n[00:34] are DNA origami.\n\n[00:36] And then I'll be sharing very briefly some exciting advances\n\n[00:39] that Anastasia led in trying to get exponential growth\n\n[00:43] from single-stranded slots.\n\n[00:46] And the starting point is thinking about DNA origami.\n\n[00:49] And what I love the most about DNA origami\n\n[00:51] is that you have absolute control\n\n[00:53] over the number of structures that form\n\n[00:56] based on the number of scaffold strands that you add.\n\n[01:00] But what if you wanted to build structures that\n\n[01:02] are far bigger than a scaffold?\n\n[01:06] Because the problem is that with DNA origami, half the mass\n\n[01:09] has to be the scaffold.\n\n[01:10] And so that's the problem we set out to solve.\n\n[01:12] Why would you want to do that?\n\n[01:13] Well, we can envision a future where\n\n[01:15] we can program the self-assembly of squishy robots\n\n[01:18] the size of a cell that might be a million times bigger\n\n[01:22] than an individual DNA origami.\n\n[01:23] We don't have a scaffold half the size of a cell.\n\n[01:27] Contrarily, another point is we would\n\n[01:29] like to be able to build ultra-sensitive enzyme-free\n\n[01:32] diagnostics.\n\n[01:33] We're trying to convert a single analyte\n\n[01:36] into vast polymerization of single-stranded building blocks\n\n[01:39] into double-stranded products.\n\n[01:40] So build a lot of material for amplification.\n\n[01:43] And again, this is something beyond the capability\n\n[01:45] of conventional DNA origami.\n\n[01:48] So I'm going to introduce this concept of crisscross\n\n[01:51] polymerization, where the goal is\n\n[01:52] to program some kind of building block that's\n\n[01:56] thermodynamically specified to assemble into desired shape,\n\n[01:59] but is completely blocked kinetically from ever doing so,\n\n[02:03] except when you add a small seed that is much tinier\n\n[02:06] than the final assembly.\n\n[02:08] And so the basic ingredient is specifications\n\n[02:10] you have a building block through these elongated slats\n\n[02:13] with many specific glues on them.\n\n[02:15] In this case, these are DNA origami slats.\n\n[02:17] Each one of these long things is one DNA origami.\n\n[02:19] It has 32 sequence-specific glues on it.\n\n[02:23] We program them so that they can make interactions\n\n[02:25] with each other at roughly 90 degrees.\n\n[02:28] And it's programmed in the final assembly to have 32 neighbors.\n\n[02:32] But it can only make one contact with any one neighbor.\n\n[02:37] Importantly, we operate this at a temperature\n\n[02:39] where you need close to half of the bonds, or 16 in this case,\n\n[02:43] for stable assembly.\n\n[02:44] So if you only made eight bonds or nine bonds,\n\n[02:47] it'll transiently come together.\n\n[02:49] And then it'll fall apart.\n\n[02:51] And that's really the key of designing a process that\n\n[02:54] will never ever start kinetically,\n\n[02:56] even though it's favored thermodynamically.\n\n[02:58] So we can imagine a growth trajectory where we have two\n\n[03:00] slats come together.\n\n[03:01] The energy deficit is represented.\n\n[03:03] One represents the cost.\n\n[03:04] One unit is the cost of fixing one of those building blocks\n\n[03:08] into exactly the right position entropically.\n\n[03:11] And so just bringing two things together,\n\n[03:12] it's making only one bond.\n\n[03:14] Well, that's not favored.\n\n[03:15] So that's very unstable.\n\n[03:18] But what's even more unstable is trying to add two more slats.\n\n[03:21] Because every time you add another slat,\n\n[03:22] you're making fewer than those 16 bonds.\n\n[03:24] So you're just writing up the energy landscape,\n\n[03:28] climbing Mount Improbable, you might call it,\n\n[03:31] to make successively more preposterously unlikely\n\n[03:34] structures.\n\n[03:35] Until you finally get to this structure\n\n[03:37] we call the critical nucleus, where finally once you achieve\n\n[03:39] this mountain peak, you can start adding building blocks\n\n[03:42] where each added building block is making 16 bonds\n\n[03:45] and therefore is stable.\n\n[03:47] But the situation is to get to this peak,\n\n[03:49] we need to climb an energy barrier of 16 units.\n\n[03:53] In other words, the entropic price of fixing 16 building\n\n[03:56] blocks in exactly the right orientation\n\n[03:58] without anything to hold them together.\n\n[04:00] Which will basically, you could fill the ocean with these things\n\n[04:02] and then wait the age of the universe.\n\n[04:04] It's just not going to happen as long as you're\n\n[04:05] close to that reversible temperature.\n\n[04:07] And then that will buy us the opportunity\n\n[04:09] to control this process by putting in a little deus\n\n[04:13] ecmakina, a single denier origami seed that's\n\n[04:15] using very strong bonds to position those first 16\n\n[04:19] horizontal structures.\n\n[04:21] It pays that entropic price and now the process\n\n[04:23] can go off and running, where we can imagine starting\n\n[04:26] with this bidirectional growth front,\n\n[04:28] we're adding 16 slats at a time, and then we\n\n[04:31] can towel around into some desired structure.\n\n[04:34] And so we can see a transmission electron micrograph here\n\n[04:36] of an object approaching a micrometer in scale\n\n[04:39] with 192 origami.\n\n[04:41] We published this work in Nature and Nanotechnology\n\n[04:43] and the station designed this beautiful cover.\n\n[04:46] So these structures are made from over 1,000 denier origami.\n\n[04:50] Each are different.\n\n[04:51] Overall dimensions of two microns by two microns.\n\n[04:55] And right now we're working on trying\n\n[04:57] to extend this to make it in more order magnitude bigger,\n\n[05:00] or maybe two orders magnitude bigger, try to make 3D.\n\n[05:02] I don't have time to go into those details right now.\n\n[05:04] Happy to talk about it later.\n\n[05:06] I just want to briefly point out I stuck this\n\n[05:08] into one of the working documents,\n\n[05:09] this idea of how to use crisscross for implosion.\n\n[05:12] So I'm not really going to talk about it here.\n\n[05:14] I'm just going to briefly mention that the point of this\n\n[05:17] is that it's how do you build pre-assembled three\n\n[05:20] to five nanometer building blocks into much bigger\n\n[05:22] structures if that's what you want.\n\n[05:24] This is agnostic about how you make those smaller building\n\n[05:26] blocks.\n\n[05:27] It's really about that next step.\n\n[05:29] And so now I'd like to briefly talk about crisscross\n\n[05:32] with single-stranded building blocks\n\n[05:33] for the purpose of signal amplification for diagnostics.\n\n[05:38] And you can repeat this crisscross process\n\n[05:41] with the same advantages of kinetic blockade,\n\n[05:43] but with now tiny, tiny building blocks that\n\n[05:45] are just oligonucleotides.\n\n[05:47] And the oligonucleotides are just binding to each other\n\n[05:49] with half a turn.\n\n[05:51] That's one binding site.\n\n[05:52] And the same process where you specify that at equilibrium,\n\n[05:56] all the binding sites are occupied\n\n[05:57] by a bunch of different binding partners,\n\n[06:01] but that kinetically it never gets off the starting point\n\n[06:04] because of this entropic barrier.\n\n[06:06] So you're writing up this climbing non-improbable,\n\n[06:09] and it's so rare to get to the peak\n\n[06:10] that this process basically never happens.\n\n[06:13] But now we have single-stranded building blocks,\n\n[06:14] so the assembly can happen much more quickly.\n\n[06:16] We have these building blocks at very high concentration.\n\n[06:19] And again, if we introduce a seed that somehow\n\n[06:21] is linked to the analyte that we're trying to detect,\n\n[06:23] in this case, Sedinia ergami, then we\n\n[06:25] can trigger the process in a controlled fashion.\n\n[06:27] So it nucleates the assembly, and then it grows.\n\n[06:30] We have ideas of how to convert any analyte into such a seed.\n\n[06:34] Happy to talk about it later.\n\n[06:36] And really, the brand new idea that Anastasia\n\n[06:39] has been developing that we're very excited about\n\n[06:41] is how do we actually get this to grow not just linearly,\n\n[06:45] but exponentially?\n\n[06:46] It turns out linear growth is too slow in order\n\n[06:48] to get truly in-fold amplification.\n\n[06:50] And so the scheme, we came up with a strand displacement\n\n[06:53] based scheme in order to cut these thick filaments.\n\n[06:55] And that might sound very difficult,\n\n[06:57] but we figured out a scheme that works.\n\n[07:00] And it's based on this notion of toe-hole mediated strand\n\n[07:02] displacement that many of you might be familiar with,\n\n[07:04] that you can think of this as how do we\n\n[07:06] break the blue and the black strands apart?\n\n[07:09] That's kind of cutting this into two pieces.\n\n[07:11] And the way that we do this is by introducing\n\n[07:14] a single-stranded toe-hold that the displacing strand can\n\n[07:16] grab onto to nucleate, undergo branch migration,\n\n[07:19] and kick the black off.\n\n[07:20] This is how we split the blue and black into two strands.\n\n[07:24] And then in this case, in the middle,\n\n[07:26] is taking this analogy with one of our crisscross structures.\n\n[07:29] So here we're asking the green strand in this middle thing\n\n[07:33] to come in and displace the top slot away.\n\n[07:36] And so it kind of comes in.\n\n[07:37] And I'm not going to describe this in great detail,\n\n[07:40] but hopefully you can kind of see\n\n[07:42] the analogy between the middle and the top.\n\n[07:44] I'll have you talk about it later.\n\n[07:45] And then here's kind of the mind bender,\n\n[07:48] is we can extend the process to now involve\n\n[07:50] coordinated strand displacement by a set of these invader\n\n[07:53] strands that coordinate in a way to basically separate\n\n[07:57] the bottom block from the northeast block.\n\n[08:00] And in that way, we can have coordinated attack\n\n[08:02] by many invader strands and then split this very thick object\n\n[08:06] into two.\n\n[08:07] And then we can incorporate that into our crisscross growth\n\n[08:10] model where we're making these linear ribbons.\n\n[08:13] We introduce these coordinated toeholds\n\n[08:15] so you have a bunch of invader strands\n\n[08:16] that can eat in from the north and from the east.\n\n[08:20] And if you have invasion on two fronts,\n\n[08:22] then you can basically get this thing to split\n\n[08:24] in a stage of midnight animation showing this process.\n\n[08:28] Again, you can download it from the Google Doc\n\n[08:31] if you want to look at this in more detail.\n\n[08:34] And in that way, we can get exponential amplification.\n\n[08:39] And it kind of works,\n\n[08:41] but we're still trying to improve on its performance.\n\n[08:44] The latest is we have some kind of variant where we can get\n\n[08:46] down to subatomol or limited detection,\n\n[08:48] which we're very excited about.\n\n[08:49] So in summary, this is a scheme with\n\n[08:51] the single-stranded building blocks that we think will be\n\n[08:53] extremely useful for enzyme-free,\n\n[08:55] ultra-sensitive detection of things like pathogens,\n\n[08:58] especially in the developing world.\n\n[09:00] And I'll conclude by just reminding again\n\n[09:03] that here specifically we're looking at how do we\n\n[09:05] implement exponential conversion of\n\n[09:07] single-stranded building blocks into\n\n[09:09] double-stranded products for the purpose of diagnostics.\n\n[09:12] But on another scale, we're longitudinally interested,\n\n[09:14] how do we advance the field of\n\n[09:16] biomelecular nanotechnology to sustain\n\n[09:19] an exponential trend in the maximum complexity\n\n[09:22] of the structures that we can construct over time.\n\n[09:25] And then another thing I'd just like to point out is that\n\n[09:27] nothing in our crisscross cartoons\n\n[09:29] has anything to do with DNA.\n\n[09:30] We implemented this single-stranded DNA.\n\n[09:33] We implemented with DNA origami building blocks.\n\n[09:36] We challenge people in the community to\n\n[09:38] repeat this algorithm with other materials such as\n\n[09:40] proteins or maybe non-biological polymers as well.\n\n[09:43] So, thanks.\n\n[09:44] Interesting. Thank you.\n\n[09:48] Okay. We have time for one question.\n\n[09:54] Really, really simple question,\n\n[09:56] particularly related to the last point.\n\n[09:58] So, how does one of your deficit units compare to KT?\n\n[10:02] So, you had your energy deficit units,\n\n[10:06] how do they compare to KT?\n\n[10:08] Yeah. So, if you imagine, let's say your building blocks\n\n[10:10] were at one micromolar concentration,\n\n[10:13] and then the effective concentration within the ribbon,\n\n[10:16] let's just say for argument's sake it's one molar.\n\n[10:18] So, that's a six order of magnitude concentration to\n\n[10:22] pull it out of micromolar bulk solution into the ribbon.\n\n[10:26] So, each order of magnitude corresponds to 2.3 KT.\n\n[10:30] So, in the case of the origami,\n\n[10:33] there's 16 units,\n\n[10:36] 16 times 2.3 is like 38 KT.\n\n[10:39] That's huge. That's like two ATP's worth of energy.\n\n[10:42] It's never going to happen. It's not going to happen.\n\n[10:47] So, how do you think that\n\n[10:49] your work could fit into their respective architecture?\n\n[10:52] Yeah. So, I have this figure that I embedded in the work,\n\n[10:55] the workpiece and also it's here.\n\n[10:58] You can download it.\n\n[10:59] So, again, this is a scheme for making\n\n[11:02] an exploded view of pre-assembled 3-5 nanometer building blocks\n\n[11:07] that each would fit on the node on the crisscross grid.\n\n[11:11] Then the advantage here is that you could\n\n[11:14] hierarchically construct each slot with,\n\n[11:17] let's say, 32 guests on it.\n\n[11:18] So, first you have some kind of mechanism,\n\n[11:20] your first level printer makes\n\n[11:22] your 3-5 nanometer building blocks.\n\n[11:24] Then your second level process fabricates the slats\n\n[11:27] with 32 of them loaded up in a linear fashion.\n\n[11:30] This is the third step where we now assemble\n\n[11:34] those 32 subunits together into\n\n[11:36] a much bigger structure in an exploded view.\n\n[11:39] Then we can also do funny,\n\n[11:40] we have more access in this exploded view.\n\n[11:42] Then when we're ready, we could program it to\n\n[11:45] compact along the y-axis.\n\n[11:47] So, this is just like a little grid structure.\n\n[11:49] Hopefully, we've all seen these kind of\n\n[11:51] the boxing glove thing that expands and contracts.\n\n[11:53] So, contract in the y-axis.\n\n[11:56] Then what we do is we remove the DNA scaffold and we've\n\n[11:59] also inserted some rubber bands along the orthogonal axis.\n\n[12:04] So, in the second step, we can take the structure that's only\n\n[12:06] cross-linked along the y-axis and then we\n\n[12:10] can compact it along the x-axis as well.\n\n[12:13] It's probably confusing, but happy to talk about it more later.\n\n[12:16] Wonderful. Thank you so much, Will."

        "transcription": "[00:00] And now without further ado, the final presentation in the morning session, we'll have Julian Engel. Thank you so much for joining us.\n\n[00:05] Hey, so I'm Julian, co-founder and CEO of AdaptiveBio. We're a protein engineering company, and I apologize for the title of the talk, which makes it sound like we are building a protein printer.\n\n[00:15] So there's two things. I'm running a protein engineering startup. We're thinking hard about how to make protein engineering easier for people so that you can use these great machine learning models to design new proteins, get them tested in real life.\n\n[00:26] And then we were brainstorming about some interesting concept for how to make DNA cheaper, and that resulted in this idea for a protein printer. So I'll go through both of them real quick.\n\n[00:35] AdaptiveBio, we're convinced proteins are nature's nanotechnology. We can do so many cool things with them in our bodies. They modify DNA, transport cargo around, defend our body against infections, and produce energy, transduce these photons hitting our retina into signals for our brain.\n\n[00:53] All of these cool things. And right now we just suck at protein engineering. So our mission is basically to turn protein engineering labs from looking like this into something that looks like this, and from making the job of the protein engineer from doing this to doing something like this.\n\n[01:08] And in order to do so, we're trying to build a full stack protein engineering foundry that integrates everything from the synthetic biology to DNA design, assembly, protein synthesis, protein testing, doing that then in an automated fashion on lab equipment, integrating the data from all of this, and exposing that to users via an easy to use software interface or an API so that you can just design proteins from your computer, send the designs to the lab, get them tested, get the functional data back, and iterate this way.\n\n[01:38] And a couple of mock ups of what we'll have coming up basically just like web interface where you can see all your experiments for your proteins, your projects, and you can then basically design a new experiment, run it on the platform, get the data back as soon as the experiment is finished, and iterate this way.\n\n[01:54] So that's what we're doing with adaptive. And if you look through like a simple protein engineering experiment from protein design to building the DNA, to building the protein, to testing the protein, and we take something like just using an AI model like RF diffusion, what Alexey introduced in the beginning, for example, state of the art, open source protein design model, getting a DNA fragment from someone like Twist, DNA synthesis vendor, and then we can actually\n\n[02:24] and then making the protein using self-reexpression and then testing the protein for binding. If you just look at the costs associated with that, right now the cost for DNA exceeds all the other costs by like a factor of 10x or something.\n\n[02:36] And that was always something that we were thinking about. And then one night in cold Switzerland last winter, we were brainstorming, we were thinking, okay, what if, so we come to a conclusion that DNA is still way too expensive, hasn't dropped much in the last five years or so.\n\n[02:53] If you look at these calls and curves, they're still stuck at something like five cents per base pair for DNA synthesis costs. So if you order this gene at Twist, you have to pay 50 bucks, although the other steps in the process are not that expensive.\n\n[03:05] So what if you could make a protein without having to use DNA? We have the central dogma of molecular biology. DNA gets transcribed into RNA. The RNA gets translated into protein.\n\n[03:17] The protein actually is much smaller than the RNA. There's a great book on that. Biology by the numbers, recommend checking out. What if we could just skip the DNA part and directly encode somehow the functionality of the amino acids into some sort of protein printer and then make the protein from that.\n\n[03:36] And that got us brainstorming. And then in the end, co wrote something with Nico McCarthy who runs this synthetic biology sub stack called code on. And that's what I'm going to go through quickly here. Now present this as if this was a working like molecular machine.\n\n[03:52] And then in the end, we can find all the mistakes that are in there because they are tons in there. So, okay, we know about the ribosome. We know it translates basically the mRNA into protein.\n\n[04:02] And now if you want to get rid of the DNA of the mRNA, we basically have to encode all of those signals for the different amino acids somehow into some sort of pattern that we can direct the ribosome to do.\n\n[04:13] And with something like 20 amino acids, you need at least five bits basically in order to do that and five bits with, for example, some optogenetic signal.\n\n[04:22] If you imagine the ribosome changing and then incorporating a different amino acid, that's already like crazy molecular engineering that no one can do right now.\n\n[04:29] So at this point, we were thinking, okay, what if you you have already all these like encoding agents, basically the tRNAs. What if you just kept them?\n\n[04:38] You put them all in like a ring and then you basically dial up the tRNA that you actually want to have or the code and that you want to have. Here's the original sketch for that. That makes it much clearer.\n\n[04:47] Basically imagine like a rotary phone where you dial up the codon that you want to actually use and then you can go back and forth maybe or you just go in a circle and you reset and then you put in.\n\n[04:57] Then you have like a signal that says, okay, now incorporate, please, whatever codon is there. And then the ribosome will produce that protein.\n\n[05:04] Okay, here is a bit more cleaned up. We just assume we have two signals, blue light, red light. The blue light opens up some sort of gate on the A side of the ribosome, which now allows the tRNA to bring the amino acid for whatever codon we're currently at.\n\n[05:22] And then with the red light, we're going to move the ribosome along this like rotary codon stretch to whatever codon we want.\n\n[05:30] And if we then put it like this, we can make our encoding scheme for whatever protein we want to synthesize.\n\n[05:39] We have our two signals. We have a rotary dial. We have a dial up table. And then if we want to start with methionine, okay, we just incorporate.\n\n[05:48] Then for alanine, we move one codon we incorporate. For speragine, we have to move three or three codons and then we incorporate and so on.\n\n[05:58] And we move along this table. And if we have to go basically one codon back, we cannot go back. So we just go like around the entire table and we have 20 red signals and then one blue one.\n\n[06:09] But it would work. Maybe, you know, it's kind of hard. Like I said, we're going to get to all the problems that are in there.\n\n[06:16] But basically, that was the idea. Like digitally encode proteins without having to use DNA.\n\n[06:21] And then you could put this basically into a miniaturized protein synthesizer where you just have a grid of programmable LEDs.\n\n[06:29] They can be very small. If you look at the OLED feature sizes that we have currently, then a grid of these rotary ribosomes where we immobilize them.\n\n[06:37] And then underneath a grid of microwelds where we can do actual functional protein testing.\n\n[06:42] And then in something like a box smaller than a smartphone, we could basically produce like millions of potentially billions of proteins in parallel and test them for their function and iterate quickly towards new protein designs.\n\n[06:53] So there was the whole basically speculative exercise of designing this protein printer. And I don't have a good idea of the time right now. Could you tell me how much?\n\n[07:02] Twenty seconds. Perfect. Then I'll stop here and we can move over to the Q&A next. I have a summary slide.\n\n[07:08] I have a summary slide. OK, so basically, it's a protein engineering foundry with adaptive.\n\n[07:12] We try to make it easy for you to order a protein to be tested. And then this is with code on newsletter, just like speculative protein printer that gets rid of DNA and basically kills twists business model.\n\n[07:25] OK, wonderful. Thank you.\n\n[07:32] We have time for one or two questions before I ask you the discussion prompt.\n\n[07:37] It just seems to be very susceptible to slipping by one errors. What do you do about that?\n\n[07:43] Yeah, no idea. Basically, in order to have any significant quantity of protein to test to pick up with like common protein assay methods, you have to have like a million of protein or so.\n\n[07:54] So basically you have to imagine, OK, I have a million ribosomes and they probably get out of sync. And then there's lots of problems with that.\n\n[08:02] One more question. Sorry.\n\n[08:07] Maybe single molecule detection could work for this, but yeah, it's a very clear idea. I was just wondering what's the photo responsive unit here in your design?\n\n[08:16] What's the actual component that respond to either blue or red light? Yeah, so that would be a light sensitive protein. I mean, they're photosensitive switches.\n\n[08:25] So I think the actual the the blue light protein basically that could basically a bit easier.\n\n[08:32] You have a protein which just has a mechanical deformation upon registering this photon of a certain wavelength.\n\n[08:38] And that basically blocks the side. But then this probably has some refractory period where it just like resets after a while and then something else could incorporate.\n\n[08:46] So this requires first better protein engineering of the building blocks so that you can then put together this more complicated machine.\n\n[08:54] Maybe if I can ask another one, how would you achieve unit rationality here?\n\n[08:57] Because it looks like your design relies in the whole thing always moving in the same direction.\n\n[09:03] But how would you make sure that that actually happens in the machine? Directionality as in forward and backward? Yeah.\n\n[09:10] Yeah, you don't need that. You can just move forward by one codon at a time.\n\n[09:14] How do you know it will always move forward? Well, I mean, that depends on the type of motor protein.\n\n[09:20] For example, if you have like a nanopore that unwinds DNA for DNA sequencing with nanopore sequencers, like it only moves the DNA in one direction.\n\n[09:28] So I think that's fairly established, although no one has ever put this together in such a machine.\n\n[09:34] Right. So then the question from us is, again, if you look at the other architectures, it's not in anywhere. Is it a new proposal?\n\n[09:42] I don't think it's a it's a new new proposal or something.\n\n[09:44] We're just trying to basically build something functional for basic building blocks so that you could even go ahead and design a new let's say reagent nanobody reagent antibodies are like a 10 billion market by itself.\n\n[09:56] Use them all over the world. But right now, if you have our diffusion, like a machine learning model, you cannot easily design something that you could sell on the market to advance protein engineering.\n\n[10:04] So that's kind of like the low level stuff that we're doing with the startup.\n\n[10:07] And this as like a more complex thing to put together different building blocks just serves as like inspiration for more protein engineers and molecular engineers to maybe get into the field to start using those tools."

        "transcription": "[00:00] This video is based on an article by Max Rosa at Our World in Data.\n\n[00:06] Ourworldindata.org is a website providing open access research and data to make progress against the world's largest problems.\n\n[00:14] The world is awful.\n\n[00:17] The world is much better than it was.\n\n[00:20] The world can be much better than it is.\n\n[00:23] All three statements are true at the same time.\n\n[00:27] It's wrong to think that these three statements contradict each other.\n\n[00:30] We need to see that they are all true to see that a better world is possible.\n\n[00:35] Discussions about the state of the world too often focus on the first statement.\n\n[00:40] The news highlights what's going wrong, rarely mentioning any positive development.\n\n[00:45] A pushback on this narrative takes it to the other extreme, which is equally damaging.\n\n[00:50] Solely communicating the progress that the world has achieved becomes unhelpful or even repugnant when it glosses over the problems that are real today.\n\n[00:59] It's hard to resist falling for only one of these perspectives.\n\n[01:03] But to see that a better world is possible, we need to see that both are true at the same time.\n\n[01:08] The world is awful, and the world is much better than it was.\n\n[01:12] To illustrate what I mean, I'll use the example of one of humanity's biggest tragedies, the death of its children.\n\n[01:19] But the same is true for many of the world's other problems.\n\n[01:22] Humanity faces many problems where things have improved over time, which are still terrible and for which we know that things can get better.\n\n[01:31] The world is awful.\n\n[01:33] Globally, 4.3% of children die before they're 15 years old.\n\n[01:39] This is the data for 2020, the latest available year.\n\n[01:43] This means that 5.9 million children die every year.\n\n[01:47] 16,000 children on any average day, or 11 children every minute.\n\n[01:53] Clearly, a world where thousands of tragedies happen every single day is awful.\n\n[02:00] The world is much better than it was.\n\n[02:03] History's big lesson is that things change.\n\n[02:07] But it's hard to imagine how dire living conditions once were, and that makes it difficult to grasp just how much the world has changed.\n\n[02:15] Perhaps looking at the data can help us get our head around the scale of the change.\n\n[02:20] Historians estimate that in the past, around half of all children died before they reached the end of puberty.\n\n[02:27] This was true no matter where in the world a child was born, and it only started to change in the 19th century, just a few generations ago.\n\n[02:35] It's hard to imagine, but child mortality in the very worst off places today is much better than anywhere in the past.\n\n[02:43] Even in the world's richest countries, the mortality of children was much higher very recently.\n\n[02:49] In Somalia, the country with the highest mortality today, around 14% of all children die.\n\n[02:55] Just a few generations ago, the mortality rate was more than three times as high, even in the best off places.\n\n[03:02] What we learn from our history is that it's possible to change the world.\n\n[03:07] Unfortunately, long-run data on how living conditions have changed is rarely studied in school and rarely reported in the media.\n\n[03:15] As a result, many people are entirely unaware of even the most fundamental positive developments in the world.\n\n[03:21] But this fact, that it is possible to change the world and achieve extraordinary progress for entire societies, is something that everyone should know.\n\n[03:31] The world can be much better than it is.\n\n[03:35] Progress over time shows that it was possible to change the world in the past.\n\n[03:40] But do we know that it's possible to continue this progress into the future?\n\n[03:44] Or were we perhaps born at that unlucky moment in history at which progress has come to a halt?\n\n[03:50] Studying the global data suggests that the answer is no.\n\n[03:54] One way to see this is to look at the places in the world with the highest living conditions today.\n\n[03:59] The best off places show that extremely low child mortality is not just a possibility, but is already a reality.\n\n[04:07] The world region where children have the best chance of surviving childhood is the European Union.\n\n[04:12] 99.55% of all children born in the EU survive childhood.\n\n[04:18] To see how much better the world can be, we can ask what the world would look like if this became the reality everywhere.\n\n[04:25] What if children around the world would be as well off as children in the EU?\n\n[04:30] 5 million fewer children would die every year.\n\n[04:33] Of course, the child mortality rate in the EU is still too high, and there's no reason that progress should stop there.\n\n[04:40] Cancers like leukemia and brain tumors kill hundreds of children, even in today's richest countries.\n\n[04:46] We should strive to find ways to prevent these tragic deaths.\n\n[04:50] However, the largest opportunities to prevent the pain and suffering of children are in the poorer countries.\n\n[04:56] There we know not only that things can be better, but how to make them better.\n\n[05:01] You can use this research on how to make the world a better place to contribute to this progress yourself.\n\n[05:07] I recommend relying on research published by the non-profit organization GiveWell.org.\n\n[05:12] GiveWell's team spent years identifying the most cost-effective charities,\n\n[05:16] so that your donation can have the biggest positive impact on the lives of others.\n\n[05:20] Several of the recommended charities focus on improving the health of children,\n\n[05:24] offering you the opportunity to contribute to the progress against child mortality.\n\n[05:29] Research on how to prevent child deaths and the fact that child mortality in entire world regions is tenfold lower than the global average show what is possible.\n\n[05:39] Millions of child deaths are preventable.\n\n[05:42] We know that it is possible to make the world a better place.\n\n[05:47] The world is awful. This is why we need to know about progress.\n\n[05:51] The news often focuses on how awful the world is.\n\n[05:55] There's a large audience for bad news, and it's easier to scare people than to encourage them to achieve positive change.\n\n[06:02] I agree that it is important that we know what's wrong with the world.\n\n[06:06] But given the scale of what we've achieved already and of what's possible in the future,\n\n[06:10] I think it's irresponsible to only report on how awful our situation is.\n\n[06:15] To see that the world has become a better place does not mean to deny that we are facing very serious problems.\n\n[06:21] To the contrary, if we had achieved the best of all possible worlds, I wouldn't spend my life writing and researching about how we got here.\n\n[06:28] It is because the world is still terrible that it is so important to see how the world became so much better than it was.\n\n[06:35] I wish we could change our culture so that we take this possibility of progress more seriously.\n\n[06:41] This is a solvable problem. We have the data and the research, but we are currently not using it.\n\n[06:47] The data is often stored in inaccessible databases, the research locked away behind paywalls and buried under jargon in academic papers.\n\n[06:56] With our world in data, we want to change this.\n\n[06:59] If we want more people to dedicate their energy and money to making the world a better place,\n\n[07:05] then we should make it much more widely known that it is possible to make the world a better place."

and reality.\n\n[00:10] I hope this is one for you.\n\n[00:12] Enjoy.\n\n[00:17] Episode 1, A People's History of Zeroism\n\n[00:23] Hello everyone, my name is Zero.\n\n[00:27] In this video, I'm going to walk you through Zeroism, which is my personal philosophy for\n\n[00:33] the future of being human.\n\n[00:35] It's going to be a tour of the past, the future, and the interior of the human mind as it contemplates\n\n[00:41] an existence so different, so unimaginable, that it drives many to an existential crisis.\n\n[00:49] But first, I need to set the record straight.\n\n[00:53] Yes, in 2022, I did receive one liter of my 17-year-old son's plasma.\n\n[01:00] However, unlike what was reported in the media, my son is kept in a room that is 8x8, not\n\n[01:08] 10x10.\n\n[01:09] Also, I have high expectations of my son.\n\n[01:13] Specifically, he must do the following things.\n\n[01:16] First, do well in school.\n\n[01:18] Second, complete his household chores.\n\n[01:21] Third, give me one liter of his plasma.\n\n[01:24] And fourth, clean his room.\n\n[01:26] Now, I'm just kidding about cleaning his room.\n\n[01:30] You might have just heard of me recently.\n\n[01:33] Maybe this year?\n\n[01:34] Maybe you heard about some rich guy doing crazy things and trying to live forever?\n\n[01:39] Or maybe the YouTube algorithm brought you here.\n\n[01:42] Isn't it funny how quickly we gave decision-making authority to AI about where our minds should\n\n[01:48] go next?\n\n[01:51] More on that later.\n\n[01:52] Or maybe you're here because you read Ashley Vance's profile on me in Bloomberg, how to\n\n[01:57] be 18 years old again for only $2 million a year.\n\n[02:02] I was born 46 years ago.\n\n[02:05] But my left ear is 64, my heart is 37, and my cardiovascular capacity is in the top 1.5%\n\n[02:13] of 18-year-olds.\n\n[02:16] After working on the scientific frontiers of anti-aging for three years, I'm not really\n\n[02:20] sure how old I am anymore.\n\n[02:23] My health endeavor blueprint has been full of surprises.\n\n[02:26] For example, discovering that my left ear has a biological age of 64.\n\n[02:31] I am basically deaf in my left ear from 4000 Hz to 12,000 Hz.\n\n[02:37] I had no idea.\n\n[02:39] As a kid, I shot a lot of guns and I listened to a lot of loud music.\n\n[02:44] And we never wore hearing protection.\n\n[02:46] It turns out, hearing protection is really important.\n\n[02:49] It was also surprising that after sharing for free everything I was learning about my\n\n[02:55] health and wellness, the global response was a tsunami of hate.\n\n[03:00] I became detested from far-reaching corners of the globe.\n\n[03:03] People called me a narcissist, a vampire, an elf, Patrick Bateman, Dorian Gray.\n\n[03:09] Surely I must be an Illuminati lizard person.\n\n[03:13] Shh, that's true.\n\n[03:15] No part of me was off limits to ridicule.\n\n[03:18] I was accused of being too pale, too skinny, too vain, too muscular, too reptilian, too\n\n[03:25] idiotic, too too.\n\n[03:28] Whatever that even means.\n\n[03:30] Wild, what is happening?\n\n[03:33] People confidently stated that Blueprint must exist because I am miserable and trapped\n\n[03:38] in a cage of my own making.\n\n[03:41] But in its implementation, I am missing the point of life.\n\n[03:46] Why extend life?\n\n[03:47] What's the point?\n\n[03:48] They psychoanalyzed me, diagnosing me with a crippling fear of death and more personality\n\n[03:54] disorders than there are people.\n\n[03:57] They suggested I am a fool on a vain quest for immortality.\n\n[04:01] But for the record, I have never said I am pursuing immortality.\n\n[04:06] I have said we no longer know how long and how well we can live.\n\n[04:11] They said I was yet another arbitrary person in yet another arbitrary time on another arbitrary\n\n[04:18] continent on a failed quest for the Holy Grail.\n\n[04:21] He'll do anything to avoid therapy, just live life.\n\n[04:25] We're all going to die, so what does it matter?\n\n[04:27] Were the common refrains.\n\n[04:29] The reactions reminded me of patterns I've seen in the biographies I've read.\n\n[04:34] In every era, 99% of those who lived, lived in the past, living by the ideas, norms and\n\n[04:43] traditions of dead people.\n\n[04:46] The future in every era had always arrived.\n\n[04:49] They just hadn't seen it yet.\n\n[04:52] Or they hadn't recognized it as the future, or they had seen it and then outright rejected\n\n[04:57] it.\n\n[04:58] The same is true for us right now.\n\n[05:00] We are no different.\n\n[05:02] The future is always here.\n\n[05:04] It's just hiding in plain sight.\n\n[05:08] It's a game of who can spot it.\n\n[05:11] My Project Blueprint proposed that a radically different future is here and true to form,\n\n[05:16] it's hiding in plain sight.\n\n[05:18] And I'm going to tell you right now, here it is.\n\n[05:22] Death might no longer be inevitable.\n\n[05:26] When I said this, armies of death defenders pulled out their swords and charged me.\n\n[05:31] I lived near Hollywood and no joke, movie studios came to me asking if they could learn\n\n[05:36] the details of my life to inspire their next major villain.\n\n[05:40] I admit, at first the vitriol confused me.\n\n[05:45] But soon I realized that most of it was just group therapy.\n\n[05:49] It is a response from a society addicted to addiction.\n\n[05:54] I believe the animosity was all just a confession of helplessness.\n\n[05:59] Amid the hate storm, no one seemed to understand what I was really proposing.\n\n[06:05] Because if they did, they might have truly lost their minds.\n\n[06:09] Alright, before we get into the details, let's start with some context.\n\n[06:14] Like the whole context.\n\n[06:17] For 13.8 billion years or so, who knows, the number is always changing.\n\n[06:23] There has been a universe.\n\n[06:25] Earth has been around for 4.5 billion years or so.\n\n[06:29] We were single cells for most of that.\n\n[06:32] Fast forward a bit and boom, homo sapiens.\n\n[06:35] Different.\n\n[06:36] We're so so different.\n\n[06:37] We're intelligent.\n\n[06:39] We think.\n\n[06:40] We think about thinking.\n\n[06:42] We lived what maybe a couple decades at most back then.\n\n[06:45] We laughed.\n\n[06:46] We loved.\n\n[06:47] We reproduced.\n\n[06:48] We died.\n\n[06:49] Just like all other life.\n\n[06:52] After a couple hundred thousand years, our species suddenly levels up.\n\n[06:58] And massively.\n\n[06:59] We get fire, language, agriculture, cities, riding, industry, electricity, nuclear, solar,\n\n[07:07] internet, and then AI.\n\n[07:10] It took almost 13.8 billion years, but finally, intelligence made more intelligence.\n\n[07:20] Finally at long last, intelligence has made a different kind of intelligence that evolution\n\n[07:25] couldn't create on its own.\n\n[07:28] It's different, yes, but is it better?\n\n[07:30] What would that even mean?\n\n[07:32] We are in fact baby steps away from creating superintelligence, which very well might be\n\n[07:39] the most extraordinary event in the history of the universe.\n\n[07:44] Life was special.\n\n[07:45] Life is special.\n\n[07:47] But this, this is different.\n\n[07:49] Superintelligence will rewrite reality.\n\n[07:52] It will pop, one after another, the bubbles we live in, revealing to us dimensions and\n\n[07:58] realities far beyond our imagination and comprehension.\n\n[08:03] This is why I started Zeroism.\n\n[08:06] Over the past few years, after hearing me explore and build the tenets and pillars of\n\n[08:11] Zeroism in private, my friends and family nicknamed me Zero, and it stuck.\n\n[08:17] Zero sits at the origin, at the zero-zero coordinate of the biggest revolutions in history.\n\n[08:23] It is from this position that we are stepping into what could surely be the most magnificent\n\n[08:30] existence in this part of the galaxy.\n\n[08:32] But before we get there, I must tell you about this Brian Johnson guy and how he died to\n\n[08:38] make room for Zero, as I think we may have more in common than you think.\n\n[08:47] Number 2.\n\n[08:49] Firing Evening Brian.\n\n[08:52] I'm going to get personal here for a minute.\n\n[08:55] In my 20s and 30s, life got pretty dark.\n\n[08:59] I was raising three kids, wrestling a challenging personal relationship, starting and building\n\n[09:05] multiple companies, and dealing with chronic depression.\n\n[09:09] I was trying to leave my born into religion, and it all started to stack up.\n\n[09:14] It was a bonfire.\n\n[09:16] That night, after fighting the day's battles, and then feeding, bathing, telling stories\n\n[09:21] to and putting the kids to bed, I often thought of one of Mother Nature's best defense mechanisms,\n\n[09:27] perfected by the opossum.\n\n[09:29] I just wanted to fall to the ground and play dead.\n\n[09:35] Maybe I thought when it got really bad, I don't even have to play anymore.\n\n[09:39] Maybe I didn't have to pretend anymore.\n\n[09:43] Despite how I felt, at around 7pm each night, I would have the most comforting, optimistic\n\n[09:48] thoughts.\n\n[09:49] The brownies.\n\n[09:51] Just eat the brownies.\n\n[09:52] The kitchen isn't far.\n\n[09:53] You deserve it.\n\n[09:54] It was a rough day.\n\n[09:55] All that stress burns so many calories.\n\n[09:58] Thousands.\n\n[09:59] You read that somewhere, right?\n\n[10:00] Just one will make it all go away.\n\n[10:03] Now in case you're wondering, that's Evening Brian talking.\n\n[10:07] He was a pretty big personality in my life.\n\n[10:09] He made all the decisions back then.\n\n[10:11] He wanted everything now, without the burden of accountability.\n\n[10:17] For years, Morning Brian promised that today was a new day.\n\n[10:21] He wouldn't fall prey to the old bad habits.\n\n[10:24] Dad Brian swore he'd be the exemplar father figure he'd always aspire to become.\n\n[10:30] Then 7pm would come and Evening Brian would push all other Brian's aside and do as he\n\n[10:36] pleased.\n\n[10:37] Evening Brian is not a bad person.\n\n[10:40] In fact, I deeply empathize with him.\n\n[10:43] He's carrying the heavy burdens of all other Brian's.\n\n[10:46] He was low on willpower and discipline and he just wanted the pain to stop.\n\n[10:52] One day, as the brownies called from the kitchen, I took a quick stock of myself.\n\n[10:58] I had gained 50 pounds, about the size of a Siberian Husky.\n\n[11:02] I carried that canine-sized fat around with me every day.\n\n[11:07] My pants were so tight I had to leave the top unbuttoned.\n\n[11:11] I was disgusted with myself and I knew my pattern of hopeful thinking.\n\n[11:15] Dad Brian, I know what you're thinking.\n\n[11:18] We said tonight would be the last night.\n\n[11:21] But you know what?\n\n[11:22] One more night and tomorrow everything changes.\n\n[11:26] Tomorrow the new us emerges.\n\n[11:28] Tomorrow everything we want is going to come to fruition just tonight, one last time.\n\n[11:34] I realized in that moment that I had more neurons than anything else in my life.\n\n[11:39] And when those neurons turned on me, I didn't stand a chance.\n\n[11:44] As I began to slip into submission, I jokingly muttered, Evening Brian, you make my life\n\n[11:50] miserable.\n\n[11:51] You're fired.\n\n[11:53] No, don't do it.\n\n[11:56] For some reason, acknowledging Evening Brian as a distinct version of me to be reckoned\n\n[12:00] with changed something inside of me.\n\n[12:03] Separating my various selves from their behaviors was empowering.\n\n[12:07] I am not the behavior.\n\n[12:09] I am somewhere else.\n\n[12:11] And I prevailed.\n\n[12:13] I didn't eat the brownies.\n\n[12:15] This small win ushered in a wave of relief.\n\n[12:18] Maybe I thought I wasn't trapped forever.\n\n[12:22] I began to understand that there were parts of myself that were unique, each with their\n\n[12:26] own motivations and proclivities.\n\n[12:29] I spent the night thinking about technology that could commune with my various selves,\n\n[12:34] hidden throughout the kingdom of my conscious and unconscious mind.\n\n[12:38] There's Morning Brian, After Exercise Brian, Work Brian, Dad Brian, Storytelling Brian,\n\n[12:44] Playful Brian, and Evening Brian, among many others.\n\n[12:49] Each version of myself had a distinct biochemical configuration, states of sad and playful,\n\n[12:56] stressed and angry.\n\n[12:58] They created predictable patterns of thought, emotions, and behaviors.\n\n[13:03] For example, Stressed Out Brian was approximately 100 times more likely to down a whole bag\n\n[13:09] of potato chips than Morning Brian.\n\n[13:12] Nobody eats ice cream when they wake up.\n\n[13:14] Okay, maybe some of you do.\n\n[13:17] Why then, right before bed, who's really in charge here?\n\n[13:22] I've learned a few lessons building multiple technology and science companies that I think\n\n[13:27] map to this situation.\n\n[13:30] In technology, version one gives way to version two, which then launches version three.\n\n[13:36] The valuable moves forward, the rest disappears.\n\n[13:40] The key to building any advanced technology is trusting in the process where systematic\n\n[13:46] and methodical improvements create compounded gains.\n\n[13:51] This is the fastest way to advance anything.\n\n[13:55] Why couldn't I apply this to my mind, my body, my health?\n\n[13:59] All day, I labored to make abstract technology better, but while at home, I got worse.\n\n[14:06] I got too little sleep, ate too much unhealthy food, and didn't exercise nearly enough.\n\n[14:12] I had completely abandoned my personal rate of improvement for the sake of technological\n\n[14:18] progress.\n\n[14:19] I was a martyr for technological advance.\n\n[14:24] What if I could improve myself at the speed that technology improves?\n\n[14:28] What if we all could?\n\n[14:30] What if decay and decline were not inevitable?\n\n[14:34] In the 1990s, this would have been ridiculous to suggest, not anymore.\n\n[14:39] With AI, it is now impossible to predict how well and how long we may live.\n\n[14:45] The night I fired Evening Brian, my sleep didn't feel traumatic for the first time\n\n[14:50] in years.\n\n[14:51] It was rejuvenating.\n\n[14:54] The next day, I was flying to a meeting.\n\n[14:56] I had just gotten my pilot's license.\n\n[14:59] As I journeyed to my destination, my gaze was fixed on the airplane's attitude indicator.\n\n[15:05] My hands gripped the controls as my co-pilot and I steadied the plane at 10,000 feet.\n\n[15:11] Flying is a never-ending activity of keeping the airplane in optimal position.\n\n[15:15] I noticed a directional drift, so I corrected ever so slightly left, then down, then a tiny\n\n[15:21] bit right.\n\n[15:23] At the same time, I became lost in thought about work, all the fires that needed putting\n\n[15:28] out.\n\n[15:29] My mind wandered.\n\n[15:30] I wondered how much better could I perform if I wasn't weighed down by poor sleep and\n\n[15:36] declining health.\n\n[15:37] I knew my life was not only stalled but in a tailspin.\n\n[15:41] If I didn't do something soon, I would free fall straight to the ground.\n\n[15:47] After a few more minutes at the airplane's manual controls, I ceded authority to the\n\n[15:52] engineering automation of autopilot.\n\n[15:55] I ceded authority to an intelligent system of software and hardware that ingested information\n\n[16:01] from a suite of airplane sensors to make real-time flight decisions.\n\n[16:07] Autopilot freed me to tend to other important flight tasks.\n\n[16:11] The airplane sat up straight with perfect posture.\n\n[16:15] I pegged the altitude with steadiness with greater precision than I could with my own\n\n[16:20] abilities.\n\n[16:21] The airplane's instant alignment triggered memories from my flight training in conditions\n\n[16:25] of total blackout.\n\n[16:28] When you learn to fly, you're tested by flying blind to any outside visual reference.\n\n[16:34] In these moments, your instruments are your only source of truth.\n\n[16:38] Relying solely on intuition in these crucial moments can be dangerous, fatal in fact.\n\n[16:44] Without visual reference points, our body's internal sense of orientation often misleads\n\n[16:49] us.\n\n[16:50] The conscious mind tricks you into believing and seeing things that are not accurate.\n\n[16:55] To simulate blackout conditions during pilot training, you're asked to wear a hood.\n\n[17:01] It's terrifying at first.\n\n[17:03] You can only see the instrument panels while you're flying.\n\n[17:05] You have no outside reference.\n\n[17:08] So using your instruments only, you have to safely get the airplane a few hundred feet\n\n[17:12] above the runway and ready to land.\n\n[17:15] You must master reliant upon instruments and trust them with your life.\n\n[17:21] That day, my pilot training collided with my ideas around health and wellness.\n\n[17:26] I wondered, could I build an autopilot for myself, one that would augment my natural\n\n[17:31] abilities?\n\n[17:32] But what should I call it?\n\n[17:34] My autonomous self.\n\n[17:36] I wondered if an automated system for health, body and mind could produce compounded gains\n\n[17:42] in me as fast as we see in technological progress.\n\n[17:47] After thinking this through, I was exhilarated when I landed.\n\n[17:51] Blueprint.\n\n[17:53] I would call it blueprint.\n\n[17:58] Episode 3.\n\n[18:00] What is blueprint?\n\n[18:04] What single thing can any individual do to maximally increase the probability that humans\n\n[18:11] thrive beyond what we can imagine?\n\n[18:15] Blueprint's singular objective is to try and hitch a ride into the future by answering\n\n[18:19] this question today.\n\n[18:22] There are three main ideas.\n\n[18:25] Number one, blueprint.\n\n[18:27] Blueprint is an algorithm that takes better care of me than I can care for myself.\n\n[18:33] We humans struggle to act in our best interests.\n\n[18:37] We reliably do unhealthy things that accelerate decay, disability, disease and death, both\n\n[18:43] to ourselves and to our planet.\n\n[18:47] We will look both ways before crossing the street to avoid getting hit by a car, but\n\n[18:51] we will do so while smoking a cigarette.\n\n[18:54] Every day we do things that accelerate aging.\n\n[18:58] And while we may think we can stop those things anytime we want, we are powered us to stop\n\n[19:03] them all.\n\n[19:04] Don't believe me?\n\n[19:05] Try stopping all of your self-destructive behaviors.\n\n[19:09] These include eating too much food or junk food, not exercising, smoking, excessive drinking,\n\n[19:16] drugs, staying up past our bedtimes, pornography, excessive social media and dozens more.\n\n[19:23] All of these things shorten our lives.\n\n[19:26] All of them make life less enjoyable in the long run.\n\n[19:29] They are payday loans and the interest is taken from the well-being, happiness and health\n\n[19:34] of future you.\n\n[19:36] It's not that we want to do bad things.\n\n[19:39] Okay, yes we do.\n\n[19:41] Bad things are easy and good things are hard.\n\n[19:45] To protect ourselves from the raw reality that we are powered us to stop these behaviors,\n\n[19:51] we create pretty stories to justify them.\n\n[19:54] Live a little.\n\n[19:55] We're all going to die anyway.\n\n[19:57] We are masters at hiding the truth we don't want to see.\n\n[20:02] Blueprint plays a new game called Don't Die.\n\n[20:06] We in fact play it every day right now.\n\n[20:09] We wear seatbelts, we change the batteries in our smoke alarms and throw out moldy food.\n\n[20:15] Blueprint is Don't Die expert mode.\n\n[20:19] This is how I personally play the game Don't Die.\n\n[20:22] My team and I gather hundreds of biomarkers from my body.\n\n[20:26] This allows my heart, lungs, liver and 70 other organs to speak for themselves.\n\n[20:32] No more rumors, no more guesswork.\n\n[20:35] After evaluating hundreds of scientific papers, we then create a health protocol.\n\n[20:40] This algorithm determines what and when I eat, when I go to bed and so forth.\n\n[20:46] My mind does not have the authority to order from a menu, eat a gallon of ice cream because\n\n[20:52] it's nighttime or peruse the pantry because I'm bored.\n\n[20:56] My body's organs and biological processes oversee the whole thing, not my mind.\n\n[21:04] Sounds dystopic, right?\n\n[21:05] This isn't the future you imagined.\n\n[21:07] Just wait, it gets worse.\n\n[21:10] Number two, the autonomous self.\n\n[21:14] The goal of Blueprint is the autonomous self where each of us improves at the speed of\n\n[21:20] Science and Technology.\n\n[21:22] We are accustomed to our technology getting reliably better.\n\n[21:25] Every year we get new versions of almost everything.\n\n[21:28] Meanwhile, every day we humans reliably get one day closer to death.\n\n[21:34] Your autonomous self reverses this trend by building upon the foundation of Blueprint\n\n[21:39] to interconnect your well-being and personal growth with the progress of science and technology.\n\n[21:48] Number three, Zeroism.\n\n[21:51] Zeroism is the underlying philosophy of Blueprint and the autonomous self.\n\n[21:56] You can think of Zeroism as a version of future literacy, a mindset and toolkit to navigate\n\n[22:03] a rapidly changing and completely unknown future.\n\n[22:08] Let's put future literacy in context.\n\n[22:11] In 1820, only 12% of the world's population could read and write.\n\n[22:17] Imagine what our daily lives would look like right now if we hadn't achieved an 86% basic\n\n[22:22] literacy over the past two centuries.\n\n[22:25] We'd probably be significantly less prosperous, healthy and interesting.\n\n[22:31] Historically, future literacy was not imminently needed.\n\n[22:36] Things changed slowly over the course of generations.\n\n[22:40] Knowing seasonal weather patterns was good enough for most people.\n\n[22:45] Today, there are tectonic, technological and cultural shifts that happen on the timescales of weeks, months and years.\n\n[22:52] The pace of change will continue to accelerate.\n\n[22:56] We are accustomed to thinking about human evolution on the timescale of tens of thousands,\n\n[23:01] if not hundreds of thousands of years, not in single lifetimes.\n\n[23:06] But that's where we are now.\n\n[23:08] We need to be alert to the changes in store for individuals and humanity to triage the\n\n[23:13] right path forward.\n\n[23:15] Ultimately, this is a question of survival.\n\n[23:19] Personally, after observing my own thoughts and behavior for 46 years, I do not trust\n\n[23:25] my conscious mind.\n\n[23:27] Not in a pantry full of junk food, not with my best long-term interests, not in explaining\n\n[23:32] away my irrational behaviors.\n\n[23:35] I do not think that humanity, as we are configured today as a society, can cooperate well enough\n\n[23:43] and fast enough to avoid catastrophic outcomes.\n\n[23:46] I think we need to hand over the reins of power.\n\n[23:50] Humanity has reached its cognitive and attentional limits in managing a complex, ultra interconnected\n\n[23:57] world.\n\n[23:59] Zeroism is a way to understand, think and behave in a rapidly changing future, a way\n\n[24:05] to anticipate and prepare for the unknown.\n\n[24:10] Zeroism is the intelligence of not knowing, embracing what we do not know, what we cannot\n\n[24:19] see, and acting courageously nonetheless.\n\n[24:23] Throughout history, the number and concept of zero revolutionized math and physics, art,\n\n[24:29] philosophy and religion.\n\n[24:31] Our modern society depends on the power of zero, enabling computers, gaming, social media,\n\n[24:37] GPS and medical technology.\n\n[24:40] Some of history's most monumental breakthroughs are, as I like to call them, zero discoveries.\n\n[24:46] For example, Einstein's theory of relativity, identifying microscopic germs as the culprit\n\n[24:52] of infections, and the vanishing point in early Renaissance art that bridged the gap\n\n[24:57] between 2D and the perception of 3D space.\n\n[25:01] Each of these discoveries previously existed.\n\n[25:03] They had just remained invisible until someone identified them.\n\n[25:08] Zeroism captures this fundamental shift from status quo preservation and rule following\n\n[25:13] of knowns to not knowing, exploring and adapting.\n\n[25:18] In the past, discoveries of zero happened every few decades or centuries, popping our\n\n[25:23] bubbles and revealing new dimensions that were previously unknown.\n\n[25:27] For example, that the Earth was not the center of the universe.\n\n[25:31] A few decades or even a century was enough time for society to reconfigure and update\n\n[25:36] its beliefs, technology and culture.\n\n[25:40] Zero discoveries are now happening at a much faster pace.\n\n[25:45] That is because AI is a zero manufacturer.\n\n[25:50] Insights generated by AI will introduce reality-bending zeros and demand that we quicken our adaptation.\n\n[25:57] So there you have it.\n\n[25:59] Three ideas.\n\n[26:00] Blueprint.\n\n[26:01] We humans are going to be run by algorithms because they are superior to us.\n\n[26:07] Some of us will kick and scream the whole way, but this change is inevitable.\n\n[26:13] Once we are through this transition, we will forget that we ever resisted the upgrade in\n\n[26:18] the first place.\n\n[26:19] In fact, we will pity our former selves.\n\n[26:23] Autonomous self.\n\n[26:25] We will begin improving ourselves at the speed of science and technology because we can.\n\n[26:32] Zeroism.\n\n[26:33] In a rapidly changing future, our best attribute is learning a new form of intelligence, which\n\n[26:39] is not knowing, also known as future literacy.\n\n[26:45] Zeroism is a response to the fact that humanity is facing at least three imminent and existential\n\n[26:52] risks.\n\n[26:54] 1.\n\n[26:55] The risk of an unsustainable biosphere.\n\n[26:57] 2.\n\n[26:58] Misaligned AI.\n\n[27:00] And 3.\n\n[27:01] Mass destruction via nukes, bio warfare, societal collapse, etc.\n\n[27:07] We need to choose our path forward.\n\n[27:10] In evaluating these risks, do you think humanity, through nation-states, corporations, ideologies,\n\n[27:17] and individuals, can cooperate and problem solve on the necessary timescales to avoid\n\n[27:23] an insufferable existence and or extinction?\n\n[27:25] I'll pose this question another way.\n\n[27:29] Could it be the case that humanity would be better off rethinking how we make decisions\n\n[27:35] going forward?\n\n[27:36] In the same way that I did with my health, empowering science, data, and an algorithm\n\n[27:43] to care for me better than I can care for myself.\n\n[27:46] A computational system of intelligence.\n\n[27:50] To help you build intuitions around computational systems, imagine empowering Earth's biosphere\n\n[27:56] to manage its own well-being.\n\n[27:59] We humans are currently in charge of deciding how much pollution and toxicity we generate\n\n[28:05] and whether the oceans become more acidic, the planet warms, and more life becomes extinct.\n\n[28:11] If our biosphere were in charge, we'd use the same blueprint process to fix its problems.\n\n[28:17] We're including the biosphere via oceans, atmosphere, land, etc. via millions of data points, following\n\n[28:24] scientific evidence for sustainable conditions, and empowering algorithmic adaptation for\n\n[28:30] Earth's health markers to be achieved.\n\n[28:33] Our biosphere sets the standards for pollution, toxins, wildlife, and weather.\n\n[28:39] Humanity deals with it and adapts.\n\n[28:43] The former me ate whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted it, no matter the damage.\n\n[28:49] Current me opts into and follows what my body's organs are asking for in order to achieve\n\n[28:55] ideal health.\n\n[28:57] Most of humanity treats planet Earth the same way we treat our bodies, doing pretty much\n\n[29:02] whatever we want, whenever we want, no matter the damage.\n\n[29:07] That's why we're in the tricky predicament of having a rapidly changing and increasingly\n\n[29:12] violent biosphere.\n\n[29:15] In hearing these ideas, many confidently assert that my motivation for Blueprint is a fear\n\n[29:20] of death.\n\n[29:22] I do not fear death.\n\n[29:24] I sat at its doorstep for a decade alongside chronic depression, desperately wishing I\n\n[29:30] didn't exist.\n\n[29:31] Had it not been for my three children, I probably would have taken my own life.\n\n[29:36] I know what it's like to be locked into a staring contest with death.\n\n[29:40] I now feel an insatiable love of life, deeper than I've ever experienced.\n\n[29:46] I also know that my future self, perhaps the version that exists when superintelligence\n\n[29:52] has arrived, may understand existence in ways that are inconceivable to me now.\n\n[29:58] Here right now, wanting life can be hard for so many reasons.\n\n[30:06] The depths of depression taught me a thing or two about this.\n\n[30:09] I dream of an existence where we all want to keep playing the game of life, even in\n\n[30:16] our darkest moments.\n\n[30:17] For thousands of years it's been the same story.\n\n[30:20] We're born and then we die in predictable fashion.\n\n[30:24] Don't die is the ultimate game to play.\n\n[30:28] Existence is the highest virtue.\n\n[30:31] The concept of God is a zero, an idea to explain what we do not and cannot know.\n\n[30:38] We are all zero and our existence could be that which we cannot imagine.\n\n[30:43] It takes courage to confidently step into the unknown.\n\n[30:48] Right now in the early 2020s, we can't assume that anything that has been true will continue\n\n[30:53] to be true.\n\n[30:55] Anyone who says otherwise doesn't understand what's really going on.\n\n[30:59] Maybe superintelligence is already here and improving faster than our minds can comprehend.\n\n[31:05] Blueprint is not just for me, it is for everyone.\n\n[31:09] Blueprint is a plan to save ourselves.\n\n[31:12] May we have the courage to believe that right now may be the very beginning.\n\n[31:21] Episode 4.\n\n[31:23] Zeroesm as a belief system.\n\n[31:27] At the age of 34, I sold my payments company, Braintree Venmo, for $800 million in cash,\n\n[31:33] the fulfillment of my life dream.\n\n[31:36] Instead of it being this unhinged celebratory moment I'd imagined it would be, it was just\n\n[31:41] one more complication to deal with.\n\n[31:44] At the time, my 13-year marriage was unraveling.\n\n[31:48] Our three kids were age 10 and under and it broke my heart and my brain to imagine that\n\n[31:53] we would now be a split family.\n\n[31:56] I was wrestling to leave my born into religion.\n\n[31:59] I'd lost my bearings, not knowing anymore what was up or down, what was left or right.\n\n[32:06] To help you better understand this moment, I'll paint the picture for you.\n\n[32:10] When I was 19 years old, I was a Mormon missionary sent to Ecuador.\n\n[32:14] It was the first time I went outside the rural bubble of Mormon Utah.\n\n[32:20] I had come home only to question the nature of everything I had been taught.\n\n[32:24] It became clear that I'd spent the first 19 years of life comfortably encased within\n\n[32:30] several bubbles, unaware of their limitations and boundaries.\n\n[32:34] I had been inside belief systems, wrapped in belief systems, each shaping my conscious\n\n[32:41] mind.\n\n[32:42] I had grown up in a rural community of 30,000 people.\n\n[32:46] Everyone was Mormon.\n\n[32:48] We all shared a singular understanding of existence.\n\n[32:52] All I could think about now was what other bubbles am I in?\n\n[32:56] If I had learned of these bubbles, how would my understanding of existence change?\n\n[33:00] If that changed, what different decisions would I make?\n\n[33:04] College was beckoning with its life decisions, major selection and career path.\n\n[33:09] I hadn't the faintest idea what I wanted to be or study.\n\n[33:13] The only thing I knew was that my experience in Ecuador had lit a raging fire inside of\n\n[33:19] me.\n\n[33:20] I wanted to spend my life working to improve the lives of others at a societal level.\n\n[33:26] To do this, I determined that I'd make an enormous amount of money by the age of 30\n\n[33:30] and then figure out a way to up-level humanity.\n\n[33:33] I told everyone about my master plan.\n\n[33:36] Nothing quite like the arrogance and wonder of a 21-year-old mind.\n\n[33:41] Now 10 years later, I found myself encased, feeling paralyzed.\n\n[33:47] Discovering my relationship with God and a marriage was a psychological conundrum that\n\n[33:52] was perpetually unsolvable.\n\n[33:54] A decade of chronic depression had not only dropped me into a black hole of hopelessness,\n\n[33:59] but it had me questioning whether I could believe anything I thought or felt.\n\n[34:05] When I was born into this world, I was told, follow these life rules and an omnipotent\n\n[34:11] being will crown you with eternal life.\n\n[34:14] Looking back, how beautifully simple if only it were true.\n\n[34:18] I am not anti-religion.\n\n[34:20] I am pro-existing and anti-death.\n\n[34:24] Growing up, I was asked to bet my existence on a hypothesis that is testable only upon\n\n[34:30] death.\n\n[34:31] In any other time during the past few hundred thousand years, it wouldn't have mattered\n\n[34:36] whether someone accepted the gamble or not.\n\n[34:39] Everyone was guaranteed to die anyways, so why does it matter?\n\n[34:43] But what if?\n\n[34:44] What if?\n\n[34:46] Then I read Zero, a biography of a dangerous idea by Charles Seif.\n\n[34:52] Nothing in my mind has been the same since.\n\n[34:56] What a surprise it was to learn that the number zero was discovered.\n\n[35:00] Of course it was.\n\n[35:01] I just hadn't thought about it.\n\n[35:03] Like the idea behind every great revolution, the concept of zero wasn't birthed into the\n\n[35:07] world easily.\n\n[35:09] It caused a stir in philosophy, math, ideology, and society before it revolutionized each.\n\n[35:16] Zeroism is a way of thinking that has helped me in my mental efforts to seek out the undiscovered,\n\n[35:21] what lies beyond the fog.\n\n[35:24] Zeroism digs into what is hidden in plain sight, just as the number zero once was.\n\n[35:31] Zeroism allows me to reach out and feel the intangible and amorphous, the kinds of ideas\n\n[35:36] that have been transformative to civilizations.\n\n[35:39] Heliocentrism, the discovery of germs, and Einstein's special and general theories of\n\n[35:44] relativity.\n\n[35:46] These are all zeros.\n\n[35:47] They were not discovered based upon what we knew, but rather what we didn't know.\n\n[35:53] Zeroism is a system of thought one level deeper than so-called first principles thinking.\n\n[35:59] If zeroth principle thinking is building blocks, first principle thinking is all about understanding\n\n[36:04] the nature of the building blocks.\n\n[36:07] Many people spend their entire lives as first principle thinkers.\n\n[36:12] There's nothing wrong with this.\n\n[36:14] Some professions demand it.\n\n[36:17] Consider the fictional character Sherlock Holmes.\n\n[36:20] He's a first principle thinker.\n\n[36:22] He believes, according to his famed maxim, that when you have eliminated the impossible,\n\n[36:28] whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\n\n[36:34] Zerothism invites you to think like Dirk Gently, a different kind of detective conceived\n\n[36:39] of by the sci-fi humorist Douglas Adams.\n\n[36:43] Dirk Gently is a zero detective.\n\n[36:47] The zero detective rules nothing out.\n\n[36:50] Instead, they begin by wondering if the impossible solution makes more sense.\n\n[36:55] It is a search for the building blocks themselves, not how they work.\n\n[37:01] When someone is thinking from a first principled perspective, they're likely going to start\n\n[37:06] by assuming the fewest number of things within a given time frame.\n\n[37:11] Zeroism, however, doesn't try to identify or rule out the impossible.\n\n[37:17] It wonders if we might not be seeing the structure of reality immediately in front of us.\n\n[37:24] Zeroism leads us to the possible, not the probable, to the previously undiscovered.\n\n[37:31] Zeros are game changers.\n\n[37:33] In a world where we are continuously expanding our spheres of understanding, each zeroth\n\n[37:39] principle insight can potentially unlock a set of more expansive spheres.\n\n[37:44] This is bigger than an exponential effect, a hockey stick curve.\n\n[37:49] With a zero, the graph is not just exponential, the units change.\n\n[37:54] The graph reorganizes its axes.\n\n[37:58] are added to accommodate ideas from another dimension.\n\n[38:03] That's what zeros get you.\n\n[38:05] Zeroth principle thinking paves the way to explore boundless terrain.\n\n[38:11] We have entered an era that will be defined by an avalanche of zero-like ideas.\n\n[38:17] That is because AI is a zero factory.\n\n[38:21] Understanding our very existence has become a quest for zeros.\n\n[38:26] Currently we are seeing zeroth principle ideas come to fruition at a faster rate than\n\n[38:31] ever before, which means we're driving into this future with fog in all directions.\n\n[38:38] Previously we humans could make reasonable assumptions about what might exist beyond\n\n[38:43] our field of view.\n\n[38:44] Deductive reasoning and a dash of first principle thinking every century or so used to be enough.\n\n[38:51] Not anymore.\n\n[38:53] Evolving, adapting, and collaborating with AI will require fluency in zeroism.\n\n[39:00] To that end, I've been working on a system for evolving ourselves so that we humans can\n\n[39:05] roll with the changes that AI brings, no matter how the terrain shifts.\n\n[39:11] The goal is to align ourselves towards harmony instead of our own demise.\n\n[39:16] So what is the potential payoff?\n\n[39:18] Well, that's a surprise.\n\n[39:21] To begin our journey as zeroists, we can seek to identify the building blocks of intelligence.\n\n[39:28] Our bodies and minds are a fruitful place to begin this exploration.\n\n[39:37] Episode 5, The First Supper\n\n[39:42] The ideas around blueprint and zeroism challenge the core of our current identities.\n\n[39:47] Many people upon hearing these ideas for new models of the future, either boomerang\n\n[39:52] some form of hatred or fall into existential despair, unsure how to climb out of the pit\n\n[39:58] dug by their previous selves.\n\n[40:01] I've seen this happen so many times that I realized I needed to soften the blow, which\n\n[40:06] led me to start hosting blueprint brunches, which I call The First Supper.\n\n[40:12] In a private and comfortable setting, I present the ideas and then create enough space and\n\n[40:16] time for the participants to have multiple existential crises.\n\n[40:21] At the suppers end, the participants rise with a basic level of reconciliation.\n\n[40:27] My favorite follow-up notes to receive are those that explain how the conversation broke\n\n[40:32] their brain in ways they didn't know it could be broken.\n\n[40:36] And then they add, they haven't been able to stop ruminating about the ideas since.\n\n[40:41] I suspect that the more time the idea sits in your mind, the more its inevitability\n\n[40:46] creeps in.\n\n[40:48] It's hard to find arguments supporting the idea that we can remain as we are and survive.\n\n[40:54] The evolutionary pressure presented by advances in AI, a changing biosphere and unforeseen\n\n[41:00] and unpredictable future events invite, no, demand that we improve our speed of evolutionary\n\n[41:06] adaptation.\n\n[41:09] First Supper guests have included scientists, philosophers, engineers, educators, artists,\n\n[41:15] astronauts, doctors, and entrepreneurs.\n\n[41:18] Each gathering lasts around two to three hours.\n\n[41:20] The mills all have the same arc.\n\n[41:23] To prepare the group for the provocative nature of the conversation, I provide some thought\n\n[41:27] experiments.\n\n[41:29] I start with a simple question we all supposedly know the answer to.\n\n[41:33] How many glasses of water should you drink each day?\n\n[41:36] Eight, someone always says.\n\n[41:39] How do you know that?\n\n[41:40] I ask.\n\n[41:41] I read it somewhere.\n\n[41:42] Or maybe my parents told me.\n\n[41:43] I don't know.\n\n[41:45] This exercise highlights what most of us experience daily across the majority of the decisions\n\n[41:49] we make about health and wellness.\n\n[41:52] Our insides are off limits.\n\n[41:54] We use hunches, folk remedies, and antidotes.\n\n[41:58] We act upon information that we feel we know without truly knowing if the answer is right\n\n[42:03] for us.\n\n[42:05] Is drinking eight glasses of water correct for each of us every day?\n\n[42:09] How would we know the optimal amount at any given time?\n\n[42:13] Perhaps if there were a way to measure and evaluate the effectiveness of our water drinking\n\n[42:18] on our individual health, we could arrive at an evidence-based result.\n\n[42:23] This process is the essence of Blueprint to implement with the precision of scientific\n\n[42:28] evidence and data.\n\n[42:31] Soon the food arrives.\n\n[42:33] Everyone has a full Blueprint spread in front of them.\n\n[42:36] The result of algorithmic design.\n\n[42:39] Each guest is primed and ready to go on a wild ride of new ideas.\n\n[42:44] Then we begin.\n\n[42:46] I pose my next question.\n\n[42:49] Imagine that you have access to an algorithm capable of generating the best physical and\n\n[42:54] mental health of your life.\n\n[42:57] An algorithm personalized to you that can take better care of you than you can take\n\n[43:02] care of yourself.\n\n[43:04] Opt in and the benefits are yours.\n\n[43:07] The catch, what you eat, when you eat, and other health-related decisions will be determined\n\n[43:13] by the algorithm.\n\n[43:15] This algorithm has been built upon the best science available from peak performance, health,\n\n[43:20] and medicine.\n\n[43:22] This means that pantry grazing, spontaneous pizza parties, and junk food binging will\n\n[43:27] no longer be options.\n\n[43:29] Do you opt in or decline?\n\n[43:32] Usually a rare few respond in the affirmative.\n\n[43:35] Yes, please, anything to save me from myself.\n\n[43:39] A third or so wants to make modifications to the deal.\n\n[43:43] Yes, but I'd like to make sure I keep the following things.\n\n[43:47] The rest, more than half, may give a direct and blunt no, or something like, this is creepy,\n\n[43:53] is this a cult?\n\n[43:55] The reasons for individual refusal are often tied to personal attachments to existing lifestyles,\n\n[44:02] and life and death.\n\n[44:04] Or to imagine conflicts that a fully implemented autonomous self would bring to cultural and\n\n[44:11] social relationships.\n\n[44:13] The thought experiment is of course oversimplified by design.\n\n[44:18] To sincerely answer the question, we'd each need to ask hundreds more questions.\n\n[44:23] My personal experience is that two years after saying yes to the thought experiment, I've\n\n[44:29] happier, healthier, more emotionally stable, or as intellectually alive.\n\n[44:35] In fact, I pity my former self, who was continuously tortured by his mind and unable to live his\n\n[44:42] best life.\n\n[44:44] It's understandable if this contemplated exercise invites an existential crisis of\n\n[44:48] sorts right now.\n\n[44:50] This is a big idea, as big as the earth not being the center of the universe.\n\n[44:57] By the end of 2020, I had hired a team of doctors, set up a lab in my home, and become\n\n[45:02] the most measured human in history.\n\n[45:05] No more evening Brian, no more late night binges, no more just this once rationalizations,\n\n[45:12] no more mid-flight stalls.\n\n[45:15] Since I began Blueprint, I have come to appreciate the many problems my autonomous self has solved\n\n[45:20] in my daily existence.\n\n[45:22] I no longer spend any amount of time thinking about my next meal or when to go to bed.\n\n[45:27] I no longer grapple with whether to do this naughty thing that will accelerate my speed\n\n[45:32] of aging.\n\n[45:33] My mind is now free to focus on more enduringly rewarding things, such as the future of intelligent\n\n[45:40] existence.\n\n[45:42] This first version of Blueprint and my autonomous self took years and millions of dollars to\n\n[45:47] build.\n\n[45:49] Most of the processes are still manual, clunky, and require a large team.\n\n[45:54] It's impractical to imagine the current version being scaled throughout society.\n\n[45:58] That's okay, because this is how innovation works.\n\n[46:02] The first versions are expensive, manual, and buggy.\n\n[46:06] The key is looking past the awkward things and finding the gem of inevitability that's\n\n[46:11] been demonstrated.\n\n[46:13] When the first telegraph message was sent, it was clear the Pony Express was riding into\n\n[46:18] the sunset.\n\n[46:20] When digital navigation via GPS appeared, paper maps on the laps became a thing of\n\n[46:25] hobby.\n\n[46:27] Blueprint has demonstrated a new approach to managing our self-destructive tendencies.\n\n[46:33] A new approach to imagine our future selves.\n\n[46:37] Can you imagine a future where we don't want to inflict the type of self-harm that\n\n[46:42] hastens death?\n\n[46:43] You're probably thinking that once your new system is set up, you'll sneak away and\n\n[46:48] insert your favorite vice here.\n\n[46:51] Just kidding, no I'm not.\n\n[46:53] I'm betting that you won't want that vice anymore.\n\n[46:56] Your life and reality will be so fundamentally changed that you'll look back on your former\n\n[47:01] self as I do now with pity.\n\n[47:05] Maybe I'm wrong.\n\n[47:06] Maybe indulgences of these types we enjoy today will be a new form of entertainment.\n\n[47:11] They'll just be simulations that make the real and perceived indistinguishable, all\n\n[47:17] while having built-in mechanisms to protect us from any biological harm.\n\n[47:22] I'm playing here to make a point.\n\n[47:24] Our minds often foreclose on future possibilities, thinking that something is impossible or undesirable\n\n[47:32] before we've even tried it.\n\n[47:34] So let's think about this.\n\n[47:36] What might be the future of our well-being?\n\n[47:40] I have an idea.\n\n[47:41] From building Braintree Venmo, the payments company I founded, we worked with a ride-share\n\n[47:46] company to eliminate all payment friction associated with traveling somewhere.\n\n[47:51] You held a car from the app, arrived at your destination, and then left.\n\n[47:57] No pulling out your credit card, no janking machines, no awkwardness, no waiting in the\n\n[48:02] car as the transaction took minutes to complete or fail.\n\n[48:07] Payment and tip happened, like magic, all behind the scenes.\n\n[48:11] Payment was forgotten.\n\n[48:14] The future of our well-being might be similar.\n\n[48:17] Magic happening behind the scenes, something that's forgotten and doesn't need to be\n\n[48:22] attended to anymore.\n\n[48:24] AI will be omnipresent.\n\n[48:27] Data from our bodies will be streamed real-time.\n\n[48:30] Systems outside and inside our bodies working in unison, personalized to our needs.\n\n[48:37] Like the stock market, micro-corrections to our biological processes will happen on\n\n[48:41] the time scale of milliseconds.\n\n[48:44] We won't even notice.\n\n[48:46] We will be too busy focused on the next games we've chosen to play with our superior abilities.\n\n[48:53] Blueprint will be applied to the care of Earth, too.\n\n[48:57] Millions of measurements taken from around the globe, science and data determining optimal\n\n[49:03] conditions with protocols and therapies put into action.\n\n[49:08] It seems so basic, so obvious.\n\n[49:12] A desire to exist.\n\n[49:15] No qualifiers, no conditionals, no pretending that any of us have the wisdom to see this\n\n[49:22] next chapter of intelligent life and decide ahead of time whether the future is suitable\n\n[49:29] or desirable for us.\n\n[49:31] We choose life over death.\n\n[49:34] Unconditionally.\n\n[49:35] But we already do, you might contend.\n\n[49:39] That's not what the data shows about our individual or collective behavior.\n\n[49:43] The data demonstrates that we are suicidal, optimizing for temporary pleasure because\n\n[49:49] we have concluded that death is inevitable and we might as well make the most of the\n\n[49:54] time we have.\n\n[49:56] Could a want for life be the most significant revolution to happen in the early 21st century?\n\n[50:03] Sometimes we excitedly race into the future.\n\n[50:07] Other times the future pulls us into her magnificence as we kick and scream.\n\n[50:13] We take credit for seeing the future and forget that we ever opposed it.\n\n[50:17] You can't go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change\n\n[50:22] the ending.\n\n[50:24] Gen Zero, let's join with Zeroism as our blueprint and lead the charge for this want\n\n[50:32] to exist into what will be perhaps the most marvelous existence to ever occur in this\n\n[50:38] galaxy.\n\n[50:44] Episode 6 Dear Gen Zero\n\n[50:49] You may or may not be aware that I recently released a book, Don't Die.\n\n[50:54] It's a fictionalized but mostly truthful account of the internal struggles my mind went through\n\n[51:00] as it contemplated blueprint, autonomous selves, Zeroism, AI, and the continued survival of\n\n[51:07] our species.\n\n[51:08] I've been trying to write that book and this piece for 10 years.\n\n[51:13] I could always feel the ideas somewhere in the back of my mind.\n\n[51:16] Eventually the concepts have formed and now solidified into a state where they seem understandable,\n\n[51:22] teachable, and actionable.\n\n[51:25] Biographies have always been a personal lighthouse for me in trying to understand life.\n\n[51:30] Instead of learning the broad strokes of history, philosophies, and technology where this or\n\n[51:35] that thing happened in this or that year, biographies give a first-person account into\n\n[51:41] the thoughts, emotions, context of their time and place.\n\n[51:46] They provide models of thinking, problem solving, and persistence to emulate.\n\n[51:51] When I read biographies, I focus on how the person was able to see something so clearly\n\n[51:57] that was invisible to everyone else at the time.\n\n[52:00] Often this is why many of history's most influential characters were written about\n\n[52:05] hundreds of years after their deaths.\n\n[52:08] It takes time for a society to form that clarity of perspective.\n\n[52:13] As I record this, it's 2023.\n\n[52:16] If I challenge myself to learn from the biographies of history's explorations and muster maximum\n\n[52:21] sobriety trying to discern what is really going on right now, I'd start with three\n\n[52:26] observations.\n\n[52:29] Number one, artificial intelligence is improving faster than we can comprehend and in ways\n\n[52:35] we cannot predict.\n\n[52:37] Number two, the biosphere of our planet is in question.\n\n[52:41] And three, we humans are dangerously at each other's throats.\n\n[52:46] Obvious, right?\n\n[52:48] So what do we do now?\n\n[52:52] Is humanity's focus correctly and adequately trained on addressing these issues before\n\n[52:58] they create catastrophe and possibly annihilation?\n\n[53:02] I personally don't think so.\n\n[53:05] Certainly not in proportion to the existential risk that each represents.\n\n[53:10] Why?\n\n[53:11] There are many possible answers one might hear to this question.\n\n[53:15] What power does each of us have individually to change anything?\n\n[53:20] Shouldn't governments be addressing problems like these?\n\n[53:23] Other goals such as professional advancement, family or other personal matters are higher\n\n[53:28] priority.\n\n[53:29] What responsibility do we have to future generations?\n\n[53:33] Why do we care to exist anyways?\n\n[53:37] We're all going to die, so why does it matter?\n\n[53:39] It doesn't matter what happens to humans or Earth.\n\n[53:43] It's the next life that's worth living for.\n\n[53:46] These common perspectives underscore the problem we humans have in aligning our goals.\n\n[53:52] We want and value different things.\n\n[53:55] We understand our lives in unique ways.\n\n[53:58] We are fractured in our opinions and goals about what matters in life and why.\n\n[54:04] We know from studying history that each era lives in their own bubble of norms and beliefs.\n\n[54:11] Change is inevitable and future humans will consider us primitive relative to their superior\n\n[54:17] ways, just as we do with previous generations.\n\n[54:21] What is primitive about us that future generations will observe?\n\n[54:26] What is potentially inevitable in the future that we may want to pull into our present?\n\n[54:32] To help us with this thought experiment, let's time travel, visualizing people in the 25th\n\n[54:38] century learning about and reflecting upon the early 21st century.\n\n[54:43] That's us right now.\n\n[54:45] They're marveling at how we figured out how to keep humanity and maybe ourselves alive\n\n[54:50] amid the greatest existential risks faced by humans up to that point.\n\n[54:56] What do they observe?\n\n[54:58] My best guess is that the biographies available in the 25th century will conclude that up\n\n[55:04] until the early 21st century, the human mind was the superior technology of intelligence\n\n[55:10] on earth.\n\n[55:11] The human mind, as long as it played within society's laws, was free to decide what,\n\n[55:16] how, when, and why to do things.\n\n[55:19] Then, in the mid-2020s, there was a swift societal change.\n\n[55:25] The combination of artificial intelligence and the programmability of biology and chemistry\n\n[55:30] proved that computational abilities were superior to the human mind for managing a wide variety\n\n[55:37] of individual and societal systems, from personal health to biological ecosystems.\n\n[55:43] Most importantly, a seedling of an idea sprouted in the late 2020s, becoming the biggest revolution\n\n[55:51] in human history.\n\n[55:53] Death transitioned from inevitable to don't die.\n\n[55:58] I personally went through this transition from my mind having unquestioned authority\n\n[56:03] and death being inevitable to opting into an algorithm to manage my health with the\n\n[56:09] objective of not dying.\n\n[56:12] Before Blueprint, my proclivities seemed hardwired to naturally be self-destructive.\n\n[56:18] These self-destructive behaviors worsened until I was in the throes of an existential\n\n[56:23] crisis.\n\n[56:24] I had tried to stop my binge eating hundreds of times, but was powerless.\n\n[56:30] It was clear, either I stopped my self-destructive behaviors or I was going to the grave early.\n\n[56:36] I was choosing death each day and I couldn't stop myself.\n\n[56:42] I was doing something to myself that I knew was bad for me.\n\n[56:45] I knew that it made me feel terrible.\n\n[56:48] So why did I continue to do it?\n\n[56:50] Sound familiar?\n\n[56:52] Why is that so easy to relate to?\n\n[56:55] I was just like humanity at large, fracturing in my own opinions and wants in life, facing\n\n[57:02] existential crisis daily, misaligning.\n\n[57:07] After hundreds of failed attempts, I found a solution that worked for me and stopped\n\n[57:11] my binge eating.\n\n[57:13] The success of this strategy got me wondering if there were other systems that are even\n\n[57:17] more trustworthy than my various selves to look after my best interests.\n\n[57:23] Blueprint has proven trustworthy wherever my mind reliably fails me.\n\n[57:28] Blueprint is an algorithm that takes better care of me than I do.\n\n[57:32] The algorithm has generated based upon hundreds of biological measurements near perfect health.\n\n[57:38] It is a revolution of self within self.\n\n[57:42] Blueprint considers that I am a collection of 35 trillion cells and aligns all of them\n\n[57:49] towards a single objective, continued existence.\n\n[57:54] For more than two years, my commitment to Blueprint has remained constant.\n\n[57:57] I know after living with my mind for 45 years that it is a devious, cunning and ruthless\n\n[58:04] rascal willing to do anything and tell any cheerful story to get what it wants frequently\n\n[58:11] to my detriment.\n\n[58:13] This makes me wonder who is the enemy?\n\n[58:16] Should we point our fingers outward or look within?\n\n[58:21] For our entire lives, our minds have been our best and only tool to navigate existence.\n\n[58:27] It's nearly unthinkable that we'd willingly opt into a new way of being that gives power\n\n[58:33] to other systems of authority that are superior at looking after our best interests.\n\n[58:39] This is the singular question of our time.\n\n[58:43] Do we humans, with our nation states, corporations, ideologies and individual behaviors, believe\n\n[58:50] that we can solve the existential crisis before catastrophe?\n\n[58:55] Or do we need to opt into superior computational systems that will better manage our interests?\n\n[59:03] Confronting new ideas often hurts.\n\n[59:06] They challenge our identities and make us feel uncomfortable.\n\n[59:10] Most of the time, we just want them to go away and will say, think and do anything to\n\n[59:17] hasten their disappearance.\n\n[59:20] When trying to solve difficult problems, sometimes we need to look for the new ideas in the dark,\n\n[59:26] where it's potentially a little scary.\n\n[59:29] If we are to succeed against the formidable existential threats we face, just how far\n\n[59:34] and wide do we need to consider searching?\n\n[59:37] I like starting at the opposite end of comfort, in the dark, where we haven't dared look,\n\n[59:43] seeking out and embracing discomfort.\n\n[59:46] Being open-minded is hard work.\n\n[59:48] It's a skill of wrestling and negotiating with counter intuition.\n\n[59:53] It might be the single most valuable character trait for any human as we step into this new\n\n[59:58] future.\n\n[59:59] If you're hearing this for the first time, I can imagine what you might be feeling and\n\n[60:04] thinking.\n\n[60:05] If you need to, pause this video and go for a walk.\n\n[60:08] I understand.\n\n[60:10] When you return, let's explore this new framework of open-mindedness and adaptability,\n\n[60:15] zeroism.\n\n[60:17] The only things on humanity's to-do list are, don't die, don't kill each other, don't\n\n[60:24] destroy our biosphere, and align AI with don't die.\n\n[60:30] Crisis has been a near permanent fixture of history, war, plagues, natural disasters,\n\n[60:35] despotism, and more.\n\n[60:37] A crisis-free world is out of reach for the foreseeable future, but we can learn from\n\n[60:42] crisis by improving, iterating, and aligning.\n\n[60:46] Alfred North Whitehead observed in 1911,\n\n[60:55] We master this process as babies.\n\n[61:00] We learn to crawl, then walk, and then run.\n\n[61:04] Somewhere along that learning process, we no longer need to think about the movements.\n\n[61:08] They just happen as a byproduct of pursuing some other goal.\n\n[61:13] Societal scaffolding works in a similar way.\n\n[61:16] When we buy a washer and dryer, we don't wonder whether it will fit through the front door.\n\n[61:20] We just know they will without thinking about it.\n\n[61:23] They were designed to fit easily through the average US doorway, after all.\n\n[61:27] Traffic lights, green, yellow, and red, are timed to mirror human biological abilities\n\n[61:32] to react.\n\n[61:34] Their timings are not random, but constrained, designed around our physical limits.\n\n[61:39] There are thousands of such building blocks that enable our societal advance from version\n\n[61:43] 1, to version 2, to version 3.\n\n[61:46] They are the invisible rebar of society's scaffolding, and are everywhere.\n\n[61:52] Each generation builds in the context of their time.\n\n[61:56] I love this quote from John Adams as he worked to establish the United States,\n\n[62:01] I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and\n\n[62:06] philosophy.\n\n[62:08] The biggest question of our time is this, how do we marry societal advance, technological\n\n[62:14] improvements, and our own evolutionary advance all in tandem?\n\n[62:19] Early in 2017, I was in the Middle East with the leader of a country.\n\n[62:24] He was telling me about his country's 2030 goals.\n\n[62:27] I marveled at how one could plan 13 years in advance with the speed of technological\n\n[62:32] change.\n\n[62:33] He asked me how I'd think about the task.\n\n[62:35] I replied by asking him to play a game with me.\n\n[62:39] Say we have a robot that we're trying to get to the furthest sand dune on the horizon.\n\n[62:44] We can take one of two approaches.\n\n[62:46] First, we could take a topographical map of the dune and send the robot off.\n\n[62:52] The problem with this approach is that the sands will shift, causing the terrain to change,\n\n[62:57] quickly making our maps irrelevant.\n\n[62:59] The robot will get stuck in the sand.\n\n[63:02] The alternative is to engineer the robot with the tools it needs to navigate any possible\n\n[63:07] terrain change.\n\n[63:09] I call this future literacy.\n\n[63:12] Of course, zeroists may even question the premise of a destination.\n\n[63:17] Maybe the horizon isn't the goal.\n\n[63:20] It's a relief that we don't need to know what the future will bring to be prepared,\n\n[63:25] because we'll never know the future with certainty.\n\n[63:28] It's reassuring that we can journey into the unknown with systems and tools that will\n\n[63:33] allow us to respond and adapt quickly to any environment.\n\n[63:37] Adapting not knowing is our new superpower.\n\n[63:42] There is, however, another option, and it is the easiest.\n\n[63:45] We could choose to put our heads in the sand instead of traversing it.\n\n[63:50] Solved.\n\n[63:51] The problem with this, of course, is that four billion years of evolution demonstrates\n\n[63:55] that a biological species survives and thrives according to its rate of adaptation, not its\n\n[64:01] rate of looking the other way.\n\n[64:04] How will we adapt to an increasingly complex, ever-changing world full of unknowns?\n\n[64:09] We might be inclined to imagine that optimal human adaptation needs to rely on complex\n\n[64:14] systems, and that complex problems require complex solutions.\n\n[64:19] However, our journey to adapt may be condensed to just a few simple rules.\n\n[64:25] Flocks of birds and schools of fish self-organize into sophisticated emergent patterns using\n\n[64:31] simple rules.\n\n[64:33] Flying insects do the same to find their food.\n\n[64:36] Under the hood, some of the most advanced systems of intelligence, including AI, are\n\n[64:41] often just efficient ways of searching through options from simple rules.\n\n[64:46] Miraculous, robust behaviors and systems can emerge on the other side of simplicity.\n\n[64:53] Said another way, the speed and unpredictability of this early 21st century is the most dynamic,\n\n[65:01] unknowable challenge we've ever faced.\n\n[65:04] The\n\n[65:08] The mammalian mind is adaptable.\n\n[65:12] It learns from the past and models the future.\n\n[65:15] It is also full of quirks, biases, and tendencies towards self-destructive behaviors that stifle\n\n[65:22] our improvement.\n\n[65:24] We can use our own simple set of rules to guide our cognitive scaffolding and up-level\n\n[65:29] our cognition to capabilities previously unimagined.\n\n[65:34] Louis Pasteur once remarked,\n\n[65:36] Fortune favors the prepared mind.\n\n[65:39] I offer a revision in this context.\n\n[65:42] Fortune will favor the adaptable mind.\n\n[65:45] To adapt, we must align our goals and systems at every level, from the philosophical to\n\n[65:50] the atomic.\n\n[65:52] What will we need to adapt to?\n\n[65:54] Only the most significant event in all of history, AI.\n\n[65:59] No previous generation has been able to contemplate a future of unlimited potential the way we\n\n[66:04] can today.\n\n[66:06] For all of history, death has been inevitable.\n\n[66:09] One day, we are born.\n\n[66:11] Another day, hopefully a long time later, we die.\n\n[66:14] That may not be the equation anymore.\n\n[66:17] We simply do not know what the future holds.\n\n[66:21] There are many differing opinions on AI.\n\n[66:23] Some people are convinced that humans are inevitably doomed.\n\n[66:26] Others believe AI will save us from ourselves.\n\n[66:29] No one has been able to reliably predict the rate and contours of AI progress.\n\n[66:35] That won't change.\n\n[66:37] What we do know is that AI is improving faster than we can comprehend and in ways that we\n\n[66:42] cannot predict.\n\n[66:43] With the current world order, there is no way to stop or even slow its development.\n\n[66:49] Nation states, corporations, ideological groups, individuals, and everyone in between will\n\n[66:55] unabashedly use AI for their self-interested objectives.\n\n[66:59] Time traveling again to the 25th century and looking back, what might we observe?\n\n[67:05] In the early 21st century, Gen Zero, a multi-ethnic, multinational, multigenerational uprising\n\n[67:12] organized around zeroism, rose to power and built global systems of goal alignment within\n\n[67:19] self between humans and Earth and AI.\n\n[67:23] Back in today's world, we can ask, when do we need to begin working earnestly on\n\n[67:28] this endeavor to align all of intelligence in a small corner of the galaxy?\n\n[67:33] AI is kind of a time travel or as our car mirrors remind us, objects in mirror are closer\n\n[67:40] than they appear.\n\n[67:42] The human mind struggles to understand exponential phenomena as we careen into the future.\n\n[67:49] This can create dangerous blind spots and lack of preparation.\n\n[67:54] Wisdom would have us act now.\n\n[67:56] If we delay, we'd load ourselves with additional existential risk, putting off for later what\n\n[68:02] needs to be done and can be done now.\n\n[68:05] The major problem is that we tend to be reactionary and not proactive.\n\n[68:11] For the most part, humans only engage in meaningful change after disaster strikes.\n\n[68:17] It's one of the failings of the human mind and a scenario that may be unforgiving to\n\n[68:22] our survival.\n\n[68:23] What if one day there is a disaster so large we cannot react after it happens because we\n\n[68:29] are no longer around?\n\n[68:31] 25th century wisdom invites us to achieve levels of goal alignment within self, between\n\n[68:37] ourselves and AI, and between ourselves and Earth that are unthinkable to us right now.\n\n[68:42] To do this, we need to act on presumed time scales that will certainly make us uncomfortable.\n\n[68:49] Whatever opinion one has about AI, the precarious instability of our biosphere requires that\n\n[68:54] we do act now.\n\n[68:57] Alignment with Earth includes many of the same fundamental processes as aligning with\n\n[69:02] AI and many of the same processes as aligning within self.\n\n[69:07] Today my daily routine is trialing a version of human AI alignment.\n\n[69:12] The past two years of Blueprint required that I goal-align my 35 trillion cells around\n\n[69:17] continued existence.\n\n[69:19] The first thing I did was label any behavior that increased my speed of aging as an act\n\n[69:24] of violence.\n\n[69:26] Extensively measuring my body and capturing thousands of data points allowed me to begin\n\n[69:32] identifying which foods, behaviors, and lifestyle choices slowed my speed of aging and those\n\n[69:38] which increased it.\n\n[69:40] A heuristic I applied is simple.\n\n[69:42] Remove all things that increase the speed of aging and implement things that slow my\n\n[69:47] speed of aging.\n\n[69:49] So how did I do?\n\n[69:51] In a group of more than 2,000 anti-aging athletes longitudinally measuring their speed of aging\n\n[69:58] using a state-of-the-art DNA methylation algorithm, I ranked number one in the world for greatest\n\n[70:04] reduction in the velocity of aging.\n\n[70:07] I demonstrated that an individual could reconfigure their systems of decision-making and authority.\n\n[70:13] I tamed my devious and conniving mind, eliminated all self-destructive behaviors, and achieved\n\n[70:21] zero violence within self by empowering other systems, in this case my individual organ\n\n[70:27] systems, with authority.\n\n[70:31] I did this to try and demonstrate a beta version of a future human.\n\n[70:36] Human Intelligent Being Trying to Self-Align\n\n[70:40] Building AI systems that align with continued human existence is a discipline in itself\n\n[70:45] and deserving of the greatest minds of our generation.\n\n[70:48] For anyone not directly working on AI alignment, you can contribute by knowing that aligning\n\n[70:54] all intelligence is the central opportunity of our time.\n\n[70:58] It can begin with self.\n\n[71:01] Every second of every day, my mind is searching for the most important piece of information\n\n[71:07] available.\n\n[71:08] What is the highest value use of my time?\n\n[71:12] What is the most piercing insight at this moment?\n\n[71:16] What can't I see, but if I could, would change the way I understand reality?\n\n[71:21] A constant search for E equal MC squared.\n\n[71:25] The task that I've given myself is to write you, dear listener, a letter that prepares\n\n[71:30] you for the future, to provide you the best wisdom that I'm capable of communicating.\n\n[71:36] This is the best I've got right now, which, as you know, will change in one hour's time.\n\n[71:43] This is what I know.\n\n[71:45] The future is not going to be like the past.\n\n[71:48] Every generation before you had the advantage of being able to learn from the past and model\n\n[71:53] out their lives, the way they thought about individuals, countries, currencies, and relationships,\n\n[71:59] about ambition, regret, happiness, and sadness.\n\n[72:02] The wise would diligently study to identify what they didn't need to relearn and then\n\n[72:08] with extra time set off to discover something new.\n\n[72:11] The unwise perceive their novelty of experience as original when it was in fact predictable,\n\n[72:18] limiting their time and ability to discover.\n\n[72:21] For the first time, we cannot look into the past to accurately model the future.\n\n[72:27] Some fundamental underpinnings of history as we know it may carry over.\n\n[72:32] However, the zeroth nature of computational intelligence, AI, steals away control from\n\n[72:39] using the past to create any future predictions.\n\n[72:44] We cannot know which historical or present phenomena will persist and what will defy\n\n[72:51] our expectations.\n\n[72:53] Be aware and cautious about what assumptions you make about the future.\n\n[72:57] Try to isolate each assumption and examine it carefully.\n\n[73:02] Simply being aware of the scaffolding you're standing on will enable you to react faster\n\n[73:08] and with improved clearheadedness when you see other patterns emerge in the world.\n\n[73:13] If you can make this a staple in how you process information, you'll be able to sift through\n\n[73:19] arguments, trends and norms and keep your mind in sync with technological advance.\n\n[73:24] You won't live in the past.\n\n[73:27] Here are three simple questions you can ask to enhance your predictions when you're trying\n\n[73:32] to make life decisions.\n\n[73:34] First, what must remain true for this to continue to be true?\n\n[73:40] Second, what new thing would make this untrue?\n\n[73:45] And third, what wildly unexpected surprise would change the question?\n\n[73:51] It used to be that society and science advanced one funeral at a time.\n\n[73:57] Now society advances at the speed at which it rejuvenates.\n\n[74:06] Thank you for listening.\n\n[74:07] If you liked this, check out my other books, Don't Die and We the People.\n\n[74:12] Wishing each of you all the best."

        "transcription": "[00:00] Hi, I would say Ed, we're already recording and this will go live on YouTube.\n\n[00:05] And yeah, I'm going to hand it over to Radell to do the program today.\n\n[00:11] Thank you, Alison. It's wonderful to see you here.\n\n[00:13] And hi, Ed. It's great to see you again.\n\n[00:17] And we won't take too long to get started. I'm just going to say, of course, many of you already know who Ed Boyden is.\n\n[00:24] But just in case you don't, he's a professor at MIT and he's got so many different positions, it's impossible to mention them all.\n\n[00:33] At the Media Lab, HHMI, the Engineering Computer Sciences, all of them.\n\n[00:40] So it's Ed has been incredibly busy for untold years in working on developing ways for neuroscience to better collect data, analyze data, work with data.\n\n[00:54] So the tool set that neuroscience uses is really the thing that Ed has always been pushing forward.\n\n[01:00] Everything from optogenetics to expansion microscopy.\n\n[01:05] And I hope that today Ed is going to be able to give us new insights that can drive us forward in this direction.\n\n[01:14] We've already started talking about this direction a little bit the last time when we had Conrad Cording here and he was kind of giving us his view on what is fundamental to understanding the brain and how that maybe differs from some of the things that neuroscience has been doing so far.\n\n[01:28] Or what tends to be the trend.\n\n[01:31] And we're going to be carrying on in that spirit as well with the next talk being for next month's talk being Chris Owen from Boxa who will dive a little deeper on a very specific type of neurotechnology and data collection.\n\n[01:46] So with all of that said, and with Ed being ready to go and all of us here, I'm going to hand it over to you, Ed. Please take it away.\n\n[01:55] Great, thank you. All right, let me do some screen sharing here.\n\n[01:59] So I've been here just about 20 minutes of slides.\n\n[02:05] Really to try to convey two things. One is,\n\n[02:10] what are the principles underlying our goals, right? You know, we do seek what aspirationally I like to call ground truth.\n\n[02:19] To understand the building blocks of the brain and how they work together.\n\n[02:27] The history of science has shown that, you know, when it feels like physics got down to quantum mechanics, right, you know, particles and how they interact and, you know, now we have computers and lasers and the internet and cell phones and so forth.\n\n[02:40] Or in chemistry, it got down to molecular bonds and the periodic table. And now, of course, we have so many kinds of polymers and interesting materials every day.\n\n[02:51] So it's aspirational because we're obviously not there yet. But what would it take to get to the ground truth for the brain? What are the building blocks? How do they interact?\n\n[03:02] So our hypothesis in our group at MIT is that in between the aspiration and the error of generating the data that tell us how to cure brain diseases and how to understand brain computations, there's a necessary building block that we have to achieve in this technology.\n\n[03:21] You have to see things and control things.\n\n[03:25] And so today I just will tell you a couple of very short stories about how we're trying to see and control different things.\n\n[03:31] Aspirational, we are trying to go for ground truth.\n\n[03:34] Are we there yet in all cases? Definitely not.\n\n[03:38] But my hope is that we can start by talking about what we want to do, how far we've gotten so far, and what are the cutting edges of where we are at, and where might we go next?\n\n[03:51] So let me try screen sharing.\n\n[03:54] Is this working?\n\n[03:57] Wonderful.\n\n[03:59] Let me try to move the bar of people so it's on the side, but not including the slide.\n\n[04:06] Okay. Oops.\n\n[04:09] My screen just went blank. I wonder what just happened.\n\n[04:12] Does anyone know what causes that in Zoom? Okay, I think I saw.\n\n[04:15] I still see, yeah, we can see the slide.\n\n[04:18] I see the slide fine now. Great.\n\n[04:21] Might be delay.\n\n[04:23] Great.\n\n[04:25] So, the general theme that we're pursuing is can we see what's going on in the brain, and can we control what's going on in the brain?\n\n[04:33] And can we build tools that are ideally getting down as close to ground truth as possible, the building blocks of life, how they interact and so forth.\n\n[04:42] But, and this is where a lot of the tension comes in.\n\n[04:45] We have to also look at the brain system scale.\n\n[04:49] So, brain cells are enormous objects right, they can be centimeters in spatial extent in our brains right, and they have these beautiful tree like architectures.\n\n[04:58] But the building blocks of life biomolecules are nanoscale.\n\n[05:02] So, centimeter scale nanoscale, we're dealing with an enormous dynamic range of spatial scale, if you want to understand the brain.\n\n[05:13] So that's one tension.\n\n[05:15] Another tension is time dynamics right.\n\n[05:18] Brain cells compute using fairly high speed, as far as biological things go, primitives right electrical pulses, action potentials that last a thousandth of a second that brain cells generate in order to compute.\n\n[05:31] And then chemical exchanges between brain cells at context called synapses.\n\n[05:36] So a brain cell would have this elaborate tree like shape, it might form thousand or 10,000 synapses with other brain cells.\n\n[05:43] How do you see that? How do you control that?\n\n[05:46] It's a really complex problem.\n\n[05:49] So I made a few animations, essentially illustrate the tension that we're dealing with.\n\n[05:55] So in the brain you have these enormous brain cells that could be centimeters in spatial extent.\n\n[06:01] And then if you zoom in, you know, the wire the brain is nanoscale right, you know the the axons and dendrites these branches can be 100 nanometers or even thinner in diameter.\n\n[06:14] So if there are what 30,000 or so genes in the human genome, they encode for who knows how many gene products, proteins other biomolecules.\n\n[06:22] Those are nanoscale and they are often organized in nanoscale precision. So these are cartoons of course, images like this cannot yet be taken.\n\n[06:31] But they illustrate where we'd like to be right again aspirational ground truth at scale.\n\n[06:37] So brain cells of course are competing with these millisecond timescale electrical pulses, not shown here in this animation are chemical exchanging between brain cells.\n\n[06:47] How the heck do we see and control those.\n\n[06:51] So I'll just tell you three short story statement how we are trying to build tools that can confront the spatial and temporal scales.\n\n[06:59] Let's start with expansion microscopy.\n\n[07:02] So, there are many methods for nanoscale imaging, probably many people on this call know more about this than I do, given the theme of this, this group.\n\n[07:12] But these different techniques like electron microscopy and super resolution microscopy. They require expensive equipment.\n\n[07:19] And they really can struggle in terms of speed and and cost to image large 3d objects.\n\n[07:26] So in our group we often think about doing the opposite of what people have been doing in the past.\n\n[07:31] And so we've been working on ways to take a brains and synthesize dense spider web like measures of swallowable polymer throughout them.\n\n[07:40] Basically the same kind of material that you find in baby diapers.\n\n[07:45] Process the tissue appropriately, add water, and as the baby diaper material swells, you'll expand the brain.\n\n[07:52] So, importantly we're synthesizing this dense spider web like mesh of baby diaper polymer inside brain cells and outside brain cells in between biomolecules and around biomolecules.\n\n[08:03] We're trying to really permeate the entire brain and the brain cells within very very densely and evenly.\n\n[08:10] We anchor key biomolecules to the polymer by attaching little handles that bridge the biomolecules and the baller.\n\n[08:17] We soften the brain using detergents enzymes or heat.\n\n[08:21] We add water and the baby diaper polymer swells, but as it swells it pulls apart the biomolecules.\n\n[08:27] So of course this does not work on living brains. This only works on preserved brains.\n\n[08:32] That's true for pretty much pretty much all nanoscale methods that you would apply to 3d brain tissue.\n\n[08:37] They work on preserved brains, not living ones.\n\n[08:45] So in 2015, we showed that this works and panel B is a small piece of the mouse brain and panel C we've expanded it by 100 times in volume, about four and a half times in each direction.\n\n[09:00] And so we were able to physically magnify the brain.\n\n[09:03] And importantly, because the spider web like mesh of the baby diaper polymer is so dense.\n\n[09:09] And so even it preserves nanoscale information as we do this fellow.\n\n[09:15] And we show that in a number of early studies, where we validated it by comparing to earlier nanoscale imaging methods that are very accurate, but require expensive equipment and again can be quite slow to apply to large 3d objects like brain circuitry.\n\n[09:35] So the other thing we've been doing is is applying a technique that we did not invent, but that others invented before us, which is color coding brain cells.\n\n[09:44] So you can take genes from fluorescent that encode for fluorescent proteins from jellyfish and coral and so forth.\n\n[09:51] And you can express them in combinations of the brain.\n\n[09:55] And this is the the rainbow technique developed by several groups that\n\n[10:01] A little bit of background noise. I don't know if maybe somebody needs to mute.\n\n[10:06] But yeah, so this is a piece of the best of the campus, a part of the brain involved with many functions including memory and emotion related functions and other functions.\n\n[10:16] We use viruses to express fluorescent proteins in the brain.\n\n[10:20] If you zoom in on a small patch of the wiring of the brain, these are different axons and dendrites. Well, it's blurry right.\n\n[10:28] But if you expand, this is the same field of view in the upper right as in the upper middle.\n\n[10:33] If you expand the brain and an image it now you can see the individual wiring of the brain, right.\n\n[10:39] So very excited this idea of using some kind of color code, plus expansion to enable nanoscale imaging of a brain circuitry.\n\n[10:51] Expansion process is pretty easy to use.\n\n[10:57] This slide isn't really meant to be read but almost 350 experimental papers and preprints have already come out to date doing expansion is being applied to early cancer detection to kidney disease to the microbiome.\n\n[11:11] It really democratizes nano imaging. Now anybody can do nano imaging.\n\n[11:16] And we, we trained hundreds of groups with hands-on workshops before COVID but in summer 2020 of course that was not possible.\n\n[11:23] And so we posted online, a simple photographic tutorial with rudimentary skills like how do we handle a cover slip and how to use a paintbrush and so forth.\n\n[11:34] And so many people have continued to learn expansion in the time since.\n\n[11:39] So to summarize this first little short story, we developed a way to physically magnify brains and other biological systems, not living but preserved.\n\n[11:48] It's very easy to do, it's already being used in many many hundreds of research groups, maybe over 1000 research groups at this point.\n\n[11:55] And yeah, one hope is that we can really make in the near future maps of brain circuitry within a resolution that maybe we could try to do things like, you know, perform computational models of how neural circuits work and the time to come.\n\n[12:14] Now the obvious limitation of expansion of course is that it doesn't work on living things. And so that's a nice segue into the second short story I want to tell you about which is optogenetics.\n\n[12:23] Optogenetics is a technology that allows you to control the brain with light.\n\n[12:29] This started when my clavator called I saw off and I were both students at Stanford and we were just brainstorming. How do we control brain cells very precisely.\n\n[12:37] And so we just started going through all the laws of physics there's only so many kinds of energy you can deliver to the brain, and we thought light would be cool.\n\n[12:43] You can bring light into the brain using optical fibers.\n\n[12:46] In the same way that electrodes are commonly lowered into the living brain.\n\n[12:51] And then the question became, how do we make brain cells sense light, because most of them don't.\n\n[12:57] And so I became really fascinated by microbial absence. These are proteins that look like the one in the lower left. There's seven transmembrane proteins down and single solid microbes.\n\n[13:08] And they're used by the single cell microbes to convert light energy into chemical energy.\n\n[13:16] So, the first to be found was a light driven proton pump.\n\n[13:19] Later people found light driven chloride pumps, and later people found like driven ion channels.\n\n[13:25] And as a catch people up to the present day what what we and our group members and alumni and collaborators and so forth have found is that basically all these families and molecules can yield molecules that are safe, fast and effective for controlling\n\n[13:38] neural activity, express the gene and a neuron shine light, and you could turn neurons on or off.\n\n[13:44] So by turning neurons on, you can figure out what kinds of, for example, behaviors they can initiate. You can figure out whether they can trigger a pathological or, you know, curative state potentially of the brain by turning neurons off, you can figure out what\n\n[13:59] they're needed for, you know, can you delete a memory or turn off an emotion, and so on and so forth.\n\n[14:06] So many.\n\n[14:07] Again, just as of the expansion microscopy.\n\n[14:10] You know these tools are now in use by many hundreds perhaps over 1000 neuroscience groups that we use to study how activated or silencing neurons could trigger all manner of behaviors or pathological states.\n\n[14:23] And so, you know, this short talk we have, we don't have time to discuss everything that's happened in the last, you know, really almost two decades since our first paper on this but really just want to comment on a couple interesting recent developments.\n\n[14:34] Last summer, a European team announced that they were actually starting to use optogenetics in people.\n\n[14:41] So most of the results to date have been used in animal models like mice, you know, to turn off a memory or activate an emotion or, or try to change, you know, cancel out a Parkinson's symptom and so forth, which is great, right, we're learning a lot about the\n\n[14:56] which is very, very valuable.\n\n[14:58] But a group in Europe did show that they could take a patient who has retinitis pigmentosa for a blindness that causes the light sensing cells of the eye to actually or die off.\n\n[15:08] They put in a gene therapy vector with the gene for crimson, which is an optogenetic molecule that we reported in 2014.\n\n[15:16] And this person had a partial restoration of functional vision.\n\n[15:19] So this is a disease that that can't be, be, be cured.\n\n[15:25] And this person was able to recover partial functional vision to recognize objects, to see lines like a crosswalk.\n\n[15:32] Couldn't read text or recognize faces yet but still a major step forward.\n\n[15:40] More commonly people use these tools to study the brain so my collaborator leeway side has used up to genetics to drive the brain of Alzheimer's model mice. These are mice that get Alzheimer's like symptoms.\n\n[15:51] And she showed that if you drive the brick in 40 times a second, the brain gets better.\n\n[15:57] The teams went on under her leadership to show that you can then simulate those brainwaves by showing mice flickering light through their eyes, no need for the optogenetics anymore.\n\n[16:06] And just have the mice watch a movie, basically.\n\n[16:09] And more recently the team show that you can add in a clicking sound, have the mice watch a flickering light and hear a clicking sound, and they will then get better.\n\n[16:17] So now, she and I co founded a company called Vito, which is trying to, which is doing and has a very exciting early data, showing that with actual Alzheimer's patients, perhaps exposing them to flickering lights and clicking sounds could be a potential treatment for\n\n[16:37] for Alzheimer's disease. And so it's early days. This is not an FDA approved therapy. Neither it's the blindness treatment that I mentioned earlier, but it points the way towards, you know, how optogenetics either directly people or by inspiring ways for\n\n[16:54] modulating the brain to treat other diseases could yield potential therapeutics down the road.\n\n[17:01] And so the final short story I want to tell you about is, you know, basically the opposite of optogenetics. Can we watch the brain in action.\n\n[17:08] Now lots of genetics we were really lucky. The natural world made these molecules through evolution that allow us to control brain activity, basically without modification, for the most part.\n\n[17:19] But for imaging brain activity.\n\n[17:22] We were not so lucky.\n\n[17:24] We couldn't find a molecule just out of the natural world that all by itself, or report, you know, brain activity with high fidelity.\n\n[17:32] And so we thought, well, if the world doesn't want to evolve this for us.\n\n[17:36] Let's evolve it in the lab.\n\n[17:38] So we built a robot that does evolution in the laboratory.\n\n[17:41] And many groups of course have done directed evolution before us but we wanted to devise an evolution robot that would give us what we want a fluorescent indicator, a glowing indicator of neural activity that would be safe, effective, fast, and so forth.\n\n[17:57] And so flash forward to the current day, we use this product to develop a molecule called Archon.\n\n[18:02] And working with show Hans group at BU we showed that the Archon molecule could be used to image neural activity with a fairly simple optical setup.\n\n[18:11] Shine light on the brain from a red laser, collect the infrared light.\n\n[18:15] What you see on this slide looks like electrode traces, but they're not, they're being imaged on a camera.\n\n[18:21] And what that means is you can image many cells right because cameras have many pixels.\n\n[18:25] And so we're able to do that with a very simple and an awake behaving mouse where we're imaging, you know, eight neurons and seeing activity in their brains.\n\n[18:37] So we're very excited about each of these tool sets.\n\n[18:41] We want to see the brain in action. That's being empowered by technologies like the voltage imaging that we're doing want to control the brain, that's where optogenetic tools can be quite powerful.\n\n[18:53] In these short form talks, I was asked to keep it to 2030 minutes. I didn't have time to acknowledge all the people led the projects but their names are on the slides.\n\n[19:02] And I'll end on this slide because it even longer list of people in the lab at the top or clavaries around the world in the middle of the slide have helped to make these projects successful.\n\n[19:12] And we share all of our tools as freely as possible. Please visit our website sithneuro.org in the upper right.\n\n[19:19] And don't hesitate to email me at Ed Boyden at MIT.edu if I can be helpful.\n\n[19:35] Yes, you have time for questions now.\n\n[19:36] Yeah, I think we still have quite a lot of time. Thank you very much, Ed. That was fantastic. As usual, a wonderful contribution.\n\n[19:44] I'm sure we all have questions even though it looks like we didn't all put them in the chat here.\n\n[19:50] So I guess just speak up or put them in the chat now if you like. I'll, I'll give it a start. I had one question that came to mind right away as you were talking about therapy for Alzheimer's patients, and I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of a\n\n[20:02] about the sort of the mechanistic underpinnings of that. Like what is the theory behind why this works or seems to work?\n\n[20:12] Yeah, so in the studies that Li Wei and her group led, they have been investigating this and we have some joint students working across their group and our group.\n\n[20:22] It does seem to clean up amyloid. It also seems to clean up tau. Blood flow seems to improve. Microglia look like they're less inflammatory and more phagocytic. So there's a lot of different things change.\n\n[20:38] And so what is the proximal cause, the thing that triggers everything else? I think to be honest, we don't know for sure yet. It's still early days, but it's really one of the reasons that I was excited to, you know, co-found the company and help get this into the clinic was it did seem to address many different problems.\n\n[20:58] And that made at least suggested to me that, you know, we'd have a better chance of being a shot on goal than a strategy that only addresses one of the many, many things that happened in all cyber cities. So that's one thing I'm excited about.\n\n[21:12] Thank you. I had a question. Dr. Boyden. My name is Andy. I'm an MD PhD student at Colorado. We met like a couple times, but I know you meet a lot of people.\n\n[21:22] I like you've developed a lot of really interesting tools, even everything from like the wireless TBS to everything you talked about today. Do you think that we're at the phase now where we have enough tools to try to get at some of the deeper questions in\n\n[21:43] Neuroscience or do we still need better tools like higher density recording probes or some type of angio recording method to get more network activity in live and live networks?\n\n[22:00] It depends on the scientific question, right? I mean, a lot of scientific questions can be answered with classic tools being used in clever ways. My first when I was doing my PhD with Jennifer Raymond and Dick Chan at Stanford.\n\n[22:14] My first paper from graduate school was pure behavior, just watching mice move their eyes.\n\n[22:23] No molecules, no physiology, no imaging.\n\n[22:27] And that was great training for me because I trained previously as an engineer learning how to really ask great questions.\n\n[22:34] You know, it's a very powerful skill and working for Jennifer and Dick was really great training.\n\n[22:43] And yeah, looking at behavior is important, right? You can learn a lot by just looking at things. So yeah, I mean, in our group, we'd like to combine all these in small brains like fish and worms.\n\n[22:54] So the worm scale Gans has 302 neurons, the larval zebrafish, maybe 100,000 or so, you know, a mouse, of course, as 100 million or so, and a human has on the order of 100 billions.\n\n[23:05] So, you know, sort of the interesting questions is, can we combine these techniques, whole brain imaging, expansion, optogenetics, and so forth, and integrate those data sets.\n\n[23:15] So I think in the coming years, that's something that we really want to do.\n\n[23:20] I would love to see if we could simulate entire small brains, for example. Yeah, that's a reasonably ambitious, but not entirely unwieldy goal.\n\n[23:32] Given the quality of the current tools.\n\n[23:36] Will we, you know, and this is what they call, this is what I sometimes like to call real science, you know, we don't know what the answer will be. So, the answer to many more of your questions might be, I don't know.\n\n[23:47] Thank you.\n\n[23:50] Hey, hey Edward Boyden.\n\n[23:54] My name is Roshan. I've actually known about you since 18 years old and since high school.\n\n[24:01] I even wrote a blog post, connecting, voting off of some of your ideas so it's quite amazing that I get to talk to you personally now.\n\n[24:10] Thanks to, thanks to Alison here.\n\n[24:14] But my question is, I guess half question more also statement. I feel like, have you heard of a woman named Mary Lou Jepsen?\n\n[24:25] Yes, we almost shared lab space when she was going to start MIT faculty herself.\n\n[24:29] Oh, okay, great.\n\n[24:31] Start up companies.\n\n[24:34] Well, you know, of course her risk as you mentioned that with brain imaging.\n\n[24:40] Her research, if you probably know is, is, is would be groundbreaking, completely groundbreaking.\n\n[24:47] I guess if not everyone here knows about her but basically she's she's building what is essentially a very high fidelity, high quality MRI and the size of a cap.\n\n[25:04] Literally you can put it on just your head. It's so small. And the actual physics behind it is very complex.\n\n[25:12] Basically she allows you to see at the level of a neuron in real time.\n\n[25:19] And you can also see there's no limit in the depth as well. And she was watching a talk she knows about your work.\n\n[25:28] Not only would this allow for reading, like if you like reading the brain reading all the neurons in the brain doesn't matter how deep you're looking as well.\n\n[25:38] But also you could with ever wins technology. If you combine the two you could write potentially right to the brain as well read and write.\n\n[25:47] And this would be another. Basically this would be a non invasive form of very high quality non invasive form of what neural link is trying to accomplish.\n\n[25:59] I was curious if like if you. So you already know about her if you are you interested in actually doing something like that with with with with the, I guess the technology she and her company is building open water I believe is the name of the company.\n\n[26:19] Yeah, always eager to to learn about technology and try out technology and yeah yeah as soon as there's something where we can look at the specifications and so forth eager eager to learn more for sure.\n\n[26:32] You have heard about that particular helmet or in the sub more of us more like brain imaging kept at the beginning. Yeah, you've you've you've heard of this as well.\n\n[26:45] I've talked about it many times yes. I see. Okay, okay. Okay, good.\n\n[26:50] Yeah. Also have Nikolai with the question.\n\n[26:56] Yes, here to ask a question that might pull us a little bit to the side I'm very excited about the brain reconstruction.\n\n[27:03] But my question is going to be different. Just relative to the techniques that you described that's just half of the techniques that you have developed you have developed so many other techniques.\n\n[27:14] And recently there was a talk about, you know, Ellen Musk in all those robots.\n\n[27:21] And there's a huge level of fanciness about surgical robots that work on the brain.\n\n[27:28] And I remember that at the time you were working on the on the robot that was supposed to do craniotomies for mice.\n\n[27:36] And how precise this has to be and how many difficulties they are. So if you can just express some comments about the.\n\n[27:47] How do you see robotics in neurosurgery in the future and where you think this can go and how, how many difficulties they will have to resolve before before being able to do something meaningful.\n\n[28:04] We had several robotics collaborations in the past, which yielded a auto-craniality robot, a robot, which is a way of introducing electrodes into the brain to record neurons.\n\n[28:13] And yeah, those are now commercially available devices. And, you know, we once what something is out there, we kind of move on to the next thing.\n\n[28:20] So that's why I didn't talk about it. I was trying to emphasize more recent things that we're working on now.\n\n[28:24] But yeah, those technologies are out there and people can use them to acknowledge they're all being used only in animal models in nurse basic neuroscience.\n\n[28:33] I don't know if they're being used in in clinical realms, but they haven't really. I did not really follow that field quite as closely as much as those technologies have matured out of the out of the lab.\n\n[28:45] We saw a few products related to those things, but but mostly focusing on new topics.\n\n[28:55] I also have a question. One was related to a company that you said you recently started. What was it called? Corbido?\n\n[29:04] Cognitotherapeutics. That's doing the auto-craniality.\n\n[29:08] Could you add a little bit more about what the roadmap of this company is and what's next for you there?\n\n[29:16] Yeah, so the company has described some of its early trials and so that's out there.\n\n[29:30] And yeah, the Red Vaughn is the CEO.\n\n[29:35] He could tell, I think, your audience more about what the company is doing right now.\n\n[29:41] But yeah, I think it's very exciting to see if the trials could be scaled up.\n\n[29:47] And yeah, it'd be also a goal to go for FDA approval.\n\n[29:54] Very cool. Okay, I'll post more about it here in the chat.\n\n[29:57] And then you also mentioned the kind of ambitious and perhaps that's the ambitious goal of simulating small brain.\n\n[30:04] Do you have any more, yeah, I guess any more like hunch to share of like what the potential timeline around this could look like or what would need to happen as first steps to get there?\n\n[30:20] This is all very new and we're exploring it actively building collaborations, recruiting people to join the team.\n\n[30:28] And I don't I don't have much more to say at this point.\n\n[30:31] As I mentioned earlier, this is what I said is called, you know, real science.\n\n[30:34] You know, it's not like you follow the recipe and you're guaranteed pancakes or noodles at a certain time of day.\n\n[30:42] I know you just said that you don't have much more to say about that.\n\n[30:45] But I am really curious because, of course, generating huge amounts of data, either by, you know, using electron microscopy or expansion microscopy or dynamic recordings of any kind.\n\n[30:57] You end up with piles of data and neuroscience is used to looking at that data in the way where you've you know, you studied it in the context of an experiment.\n\n[31:07] And then you make a hypothesis and then you build a model and then you make a model that then tries to predict something that you then test.\n\n[31:14] But there really hasn't been that much work in taking data directly from this big pile of measured data and then trying to populate the parameters of a model based on that.\n\n[31:25] I think that some of the work that that, for instance, Professor Lou Scheffer is trying to do at Janelia right now to try to model visual neurons in Drosophila based on on data that they actually acquired from electron microscopy is very interesting.\n\n[31:40] But I don't see a huge plethora of that kind of work.\n\n[31:44] And it feels to me like you get the best results from this kind of brain mapping science and all this technology that's being developed around it.\n\n[31:52] If you have a feedback loop right where you're trying to use the data that's being collected to make something to then see how well it works, how well it predicts.\n\n[32:01] And then to go back and say, well, actually, we needed to measure this a little bit differently, or we really need that data or something like that.\n\n[32:08] You want to have this cycle going on. Where would you say is the best example of that kind of work that you know of if you care to share?\n\n[32:20] Yeah, great question. I mean, yeah, I think the, you know, Eve Marder, of course, has done beautiful work where they, on the Crab Somatic Astro Ganglion, where they can record all the neurons, they know the wiring, they can look at the molecular\n\n[32:37] content, and then they analyze the data from very first principles ways. You know, they look at the how does the gene expression, you know, across cells correlate?\n\n[32:46] How does the, you know, what kind of parameters could generate a given output pattern? So I always learn a lot from her papers.\n\n[32:53] That's a good example.\n\n[32:55] Yeah.\n\n[32:57] I think Nikola also mentioned Sebastian Tung.\n\n[33:03] Yeah, that was an example.\n\n[33:05] You all know Sebastian Tung's work. They spent lots of time, money and involvement to rebuild a millimeter of human retina.\n\n[33:16] And the outcome that he did was that he was able to use that structure to recapture a model that exists from the 60s about the function of the area detecting moving images.\n\n[33:33] And I think that the big problem between fixed data and data in motion in dynamics is it's the scale. It's always scaling it up.\n\n[33:51] Was the question how to scale up or I didn't quite follow the end?\n\n[33:55] No, it was more of a comment. It's the scale. It's, I mean, the clarity technique. It's a great way to reveal structural properties of the brain.\n\n[34:08] Transferring it into the dynamics of the brain.\n\n[34:13] It's difficult. It's difficult because of scaling. It's difficult because of looking at different examples of elements interacting and acting.\n\n[34:28] That's exactly why I sort of prefaced the talk by saying that we want to think of the temporal spatial scales as the most important drivers of what we want, right?\n\n[34:36] And that's why expansionary microscopy lets you do scalable neural imaging. It's why, you know, optogenetics and imaging and neural dynamics scale because cameras and computers are always getting better and better.\n\n[34:48] Yeah, so scale is really one of the prime drivers of the technologies we build.\n\n[34:55] Okay, wonderful. We have two folks lined up, Steve, Potter and Andrew. Do you want to go first, Steve?\n\n[35:01] Okay, thanks. Fantastic stuff, Ed, as always. I wanted you to talk a little bit more about the Sommel-Arkin voltage sensitive fluorescent protein.\n\n[35:14] You know, this has been a holy grail. I've been following this since Larry Cohen was doing his dyes and to get a protein that has this single spike resolution, single cell resolution, millisecond resolution is fantastic.\n\n[35:28] What are the limitations? Like, why isn't this? It seems like that would have been just like the revolution that would give us the most ground truth of what's going on in the brain of any technology I could think of,\n\n[35:40] especially when you combine it with optogenetic stimulation of the neurons using the same optics that you're doing some recording with.\n\n[35:48] So what are the current limitations and why are we really taking off with this like you were with optogenetics when that came out?\n\n[35:57] Yeah, so, first of all, it's just new, right? I mean, our first object pair was 2005. You know, a lot of the discovery oriented papers started really pouring out at a rapid rate, 2009, 2010, 2011.\n\n[36:13] You know, no technology exists in isolation, so we can build an indicator, but something might need to, you know, you might need a fast camera, you might need, you know, an optical setup, you know, there's a lot of moving parts.\n\n[36:24] So, I do think that there is a cycle beginning where, oh, you got a new indicator, let's try to build a microscope that, you know, optimally interfaces to it. Let's, you know, but no technology exists in a vacuum.\n\n[36:36] Second thing is that I think it is very clear that nobody's made a perfect voltage indicator. So as I was trying to elude to during the talk, you know, with optogenetics, we're just so lucky that these molecules out of the wild, off the shelf, so to speak, were strong enough, fast enough and safe enough that, you know, you can use them to drive and cancel neural activity.\n\n[36:54] So for voltage indicators, you know, Archon is a very high dynamic range, very good signal to noise, not as bright as some of the others, of course, there are lots of the molecules that are much brighter, but they have smaller dynamic range and lower signal to noise quite often.\n\n[37:09] And then, so yeah, I think making a molecule that's bright, high dynamic range, fast, doesn't photo bleach, the perfect voltage indicator, I think you could argue has not been invented yet. So we have many others are continuing to try to screen for molecules that are, you know, you know, fast, bright, high dynamic range, all these things at the same time.\n\n[37:37] Are these voltage indicators amenable to light sheet microscopy?\n\n[37:41] I mean, actually, I guess, you know, the molecule will take light from whatever source and will then emit it. So light sheet, there's light field microscopy, you know, all manner of microscopy. Yeah, I think there's a bit of a mix and matching that could be done where we have different indicators and different styles of imaging.\n\n[38:07] And then there's also different brain. It also depends on what species one is looking at, you know, our group is working a lot on small animals like fish and worms where, you know, you know, if you have a light sheet microscope which has a fairly small volume that will fit between the two lenses, you know, a small brain might be one that's preferred.\n\n[38:24] But of course, you know, there are large brains too that people work on like mice and others.\n\n[38:28] So it might depend on the exact side of the question, if can, to be honest.\n\n[38:38] Inodding.\n\n[38:39] Next on we have Andy.\n\n[38:44] Andy, you might just mute it.\n\n[38:52] Thanks for that.\n\n[38:54] The answer to this is probably I don't know, or it depends.\n\n[38:58] But if you were finishing your PhD around now and you were interested in building either\n\n[39:07] therapeutic or commercial market products and tools, do you think that pursuing a more\n\n[39:16] traditional academic path, professorship and grants and spinning out IP with university\n\n[39:24] or going more straight towards a private route is best in the type of environment we're in,\n\n[39:33] given the work that people like you have done to give us so many great tools and understandings.\n\n[39:41] So it kind of does depend, right?\n\n[39:48] Because a PhD that was very clinical might have a different path than a PhD was pure\n\n[39:52] programming, right?\n\n[39:53] A PhD that was very experimental and hands on might be different from one that was more\n\n[39:57] theory oriented.\n\n[39:58] And of course, there were different time scales, right?\n\n[40:02] I mean, the time between our first genetics paper and the paper Nature Medicine last summer\n\n[40:08] that showed the first data in people was what, almost 17 years?\n\n[40:13] So that's probably longer than a dilutive capital funded startup would probably be able\n\n[40:18] to tolerate.\n\n[40:22] And so on the other hand, when the project that Leeway led on movies for Alzheimer's,\n\n[40:35] you know, doing a scaled human trial, you know, is something that could be envisioned\n\n[40:45] on a reasonably short time scale, right?\n\n[40:47] So yeah, probably depends on the nature of what the PhD is about, what the nature of\n\n[40:50] the problem is.\n\n[40:51] Yeah, did you have something specific in mind?\n\n[40:56] Yeah, so I do in vivo electrophysiology, I work pretty closely with neurosurgical teams.\n\n[41:05] One of your ventures, like the inner cosmos idea that you and a few others were working\n\n[41:09] on, like some sort of neural modulatory approach leveraging things like wireless DBS and TMS\n\n[41:16] and maybe near infrared recordings, like that type of thing.\n\n[41:20] I don't know, I guess, yeah, that's the route.\n\n[41:24] That's my background.\n\n[41:25] That's the skill set I have and what I'm interested in.\n\n[41:29] And I don't know, it seems pretty even in my mind, which route would be most advantageous.\n\n[41:36] But yeah.\n\n[41:37] Yeah, well, the other thing too is that new skill sets can be acquired, right?\n\n[41:46] And as we discussed earlier, some things like in vivo physiology could be automated so that,\n\n[41:52] you know, the skill required to do it would be far less.\n\n[41:57] So the skills are always evolving and the technology is always evolving.\n\n[42:01] Yeah, so it kind of depends, you know, whether one is sort of driven by a kind of impact,\n\n[42:06] right?\n\n[42:07] You want to solve this problem and if you just switch fields and become a chemist, that's\n\n[42:10] what you do.\n\n[42:11] Or do you like a certain skill?\n\n[42:12] You know, some people just like to write code, you know, are they going to do it for Amazon\n\n[42:16] or Google or for a startup or for an academic group?\n\n[42:19] You know, that's negotiable.\n\n[42:20] So it depends if you're skill driven or impact driven.\n\n[42:25] Yeah, thank you.\n\n[42:28] Wonderful.\n\n[42:29] We had another question, I think, from Rashan.\n\n[42:33] Do you want to ask it yourself?\n\n[42:36] Yes, I just wanted to know if Boyden has heard about bioelectric computation outside of the\n\n[42:48] nervous system research by Professor Michael Levin from the Alan Discovery Center at the\n\n[42:56] Tufts University.\n\n[42:57] It's a recent, it's quite very recent, but I would say completely groundbreaking research\n\n[43:04] when it comes to, well, biology and generally, well, a lot of different things.\n\n[43:11] But yeah, I'm just curious, have you even have you heard about this?\n\n[43:15] Oh, absolutely.\n\n[43:16] Yeah.\n\n[43:18] So, you know, the brain cells are used as a tool to drive electrical functions.\n\n[43:22] They use one of them to drive regeneration of a tadpole tail, if I recall.\n\n[43:26] Yes, yes, yeah, exactly.\n\n[43:28] The use of the molecule we published in 2010 to do that.\n\n[43:32] And yeah, there are lots of computations that occur without brain cells.\n\n[43:36] I mean, you know, even beyond electricity, you know, cells in the body are thousands\n\n[43:42] of gene products and they're sensing and they're acting.\n\n[43:45] I mean, our immune system is a great example, right?\n\n[43:47] It's a great example of how the brain can fight the invader.\n\n[43:51] It can fight it, it has memory, right?\n\n[43:53] You know, it remembers the invaders, so it can fight it better the next time.\n\n[43:57] That's how vaccines work and so forth.\n\n[43:59] Yeah, it did.\n\n[44:01] And people even have mapped out some of the pathways and immune cells and they have, you\n\n[44:06] know, very interesting relationships to the pathways that are involved with human or neural\n\n[44:13] computations of different kinds.\n\n[44:16] And so, you know, I think it's a way of taking some kind of input, making some kind of\n\n[44:20] evaluation of what to do, and then making some kind of output.\n\n[44:24] I think it boils down to the simple problem that all living things have, but is that\n\n[44:28] your cells or your brain can anticipate many outcomes.\n\n[44:31] But at the end, your body has to do approximately one or a few things, right?\n\n[44:36] You know, I can't be out finding food and finding water and avoiding the lion and\n\n[44:40] everything all at the same time.\n\n[44:42] At least it sounds like a stressful day if I'm doing all that.\n\n[44:45] But and so, yeah, I think I think computation is ubiquitous.\n\n[44:49] And Michael's work is a great example of that.\n\n[44:53] Lots of people now are finding that very simple organisms can do extremely sophisticated\n\n[44:56] things.\n\n[44:58] Yeah, they showed it was I found it so amazing when he didn't necessarily show this, but\n\n[45:02] this is one example when he talked about the how the butterfly when it first is a\n\n[45:09] caterpillar, it will actually even though when it's transforming into a butterfly,\n\n[45:15] its body turns into basically indifferentiated goop.\n\n[45:19] There is no brain cells.\n\n[45:21] There's no skin cells.\n\n[45:23] There's no body cells.\n\n[45:25] It's all indifferentiated as it as it then turns into into a butterfly, but it will\n\n[45:30] actually remember things that it learned when it was a caterpillar.\n\n[45:36] After it turns into a butterfly.\n\n[45:39] It's amazing.\n\n[45:40] Memories don't even need to exist within the connections between the neurons.\n\n[45:45] It's just completely.\n\n[45:47] And of course, they show other things as well, like the fact that you can actually see\n\n[45:52] like a bioelectric outline of a face of the tadpole before the face even forms.\n\n[46:00] That completely blew my mind.\n\n[46:03] I shared more info on Michael Levin's talk also in here for those of you guys who want\n\n[46:09] to know more about it.\n\n[46:11] We also have a few more folks and Kew, I think we have Steve and then Wendell again,\n\n[46:17] just watching the time if not 10 more minutes.\n\n[46:28] Steve, would you like to unmute?\n\n[46:30] No, thanks. I had just accidentally left my hand up.\n\n[46:34] I enjoyed listening.\n\n[46:36] Let me have Brandon.\n\n[46:37] I just wanted to try to see if I could turn things around for a second, because, you\n\n[46:41] know, we're we've started this neuro group and we get together every once in a while\n\n[46:45] and it was so nice to come out and give us a talk and to field answers to all of our\n\n[46:51] questions. I was wondering, what can we do for you?\n\n[46:55] Like, what is it that makes you want to come talk at a group like this?\n\n[46:59] What are you hoping that maybe you could get out of it?\n\n[47:02] Is there something that anyone can help you with or what is your biggest desire right\n\n[47:06] now that you'd like to push forward either in general or for your group or your\n\n[47:12] lab? Is there something, anything like that?\n\n[47:17] Well, I think we're in serendipity, you know, but we discoveries are driven by\n\n[47:23] luck. So we're always looking out.\n\n[47:25] I think I CRISPR, right?\n\n[47:27] They got PCR, you know, penicillin.\n\n[47:29] These are all stumbled across by basically by accident, right?\n\n[47:32] The natural molecules aspirin, right?\n\n[47:34] Optogenetics comes from natural molecules.\n\n[47:37] So, yeah, I've always tried to find out, you know, how do we build the the team\n\n[47:43] with the insights that will get the next revolution?\n\n[47:46] And and so we're launching a network to try to collect organisms from all over\n\n[47:53] the earth, which we could then analyze for new tools.\n\n[47:57] Yeah, I'm always I'm always seeking serendipity.\n\n[48:01] Serendipity, it is then.\n\n[48:03] OK, fantastic.\n\n[48:06] I want to be able to.\n\n[48:09] I can I comment on Randall's question?\n\n[48:13] I think something that we could really use in this field is somebody like Carl\n\n[48:19] Sagan, who could, you know, be a spokesperson to the lay public to get a\n\n[48:24] little bit more acceptance and more excitement about it.\n\n[48:27] You know, there are a few few people out there who are trying to do this.\n\n[48:33] David Eagleman is and, you know, Stephen Fry had a very good series on the\n\n[48:39] brain.\n\n[48:41] It wasn't a whole lot of this high tech stuff, though, in it.\n\n[48:45] I think if anybody here wants to become the spokesperson for this, I think that\n\n[48:49] would be wonderful.\n\n[48:51] That's a good idea.\n\n[48:53] Right.\n\n[48:55] I mean, I think that adds to quite a lot of that, at least whenever I have\n\n[48:59] someone that your name always usually pops up as the first one that people feel\n\n[49:03] really inspired by.\n\n[49:05] So whether it's accidental or whether it's on purpose, I think it's happening\n\n[49:10] to some extent.\n\n[49:12] I think also one question that we always ask our speakers, which we send by\n\n[49:16] email is if there's one challenge that you think could really advance this field\n\n[49:22] tremendously, then where you're always like, I just wish this one particular\n\n[49:26] thing was solved that you want to put out there for potential others to take on\n\n[49:32] what comes to mind.\n\n[49:36] Oh,\n\n[49:39] do you want me to describe a problem that needs to solve there?\n\n[49:42] Yeah, a problem that needs solving where you like, but only this one particular\n\n[49:45] thing was solved.\n\n[49:46] Then all of that work in our area would be much easier.\n\n[49:49] This can be something inside of your field, but it could also just be perhaps\n\n[49:52] an adjacent field that just needs to progress so that you can make more\n\n[49:55] progress using those tools.\n\n[49:56] And we talked a bit about tools before, but I think we always want to just\n\n[50:00] leave space for like, what's the number one thing that people in the field\n\n[50:03] think needs to happen to drive the field forward?\n\n[50:12] Good question.\n\n[50:14] The problem is we often don't know what we don't know.\n\n[50:16] There's so many molecules in the brain that people characterize at the chemical\n\n[50:20] level, but we don't know what they do at the systems level.\n\n[50:23] For example, some brain cells will generate gases like nitric oxide.\n\n[50:29] What are they doing in a specific behavior?\n\n[50:31] Well, we don't have the tools to see or control nitric oxide in specific 3D\n\n[50:36] locations throughout a brain and awake behaving animals.\n\n[50:40] That's my knowledge.\n\n[50:41] Canabinoids, right?\n\n[50:42] Brain cells make molecules that have some of the same features of the active\n\n[50:47] ingredients in marijuana.\n\n[50:48] What are they doing?\n\n[50:49] The list of things that we don't know is just so large.\n\n[50:56] We need to see everything in the brain and control everything in the brain, I guess.\n\n[51:02] That's at a very early stage.\n\n[51:06] Wonderful.\n\n[51:08] Thanks, Brenda.\n\n[51:09] I'm not sure if you'd like to close it out.\n\n[51:11] You're welcome to.\n\n[51:12] No, you can go ahead and close it out.\n\n[51:13] Sure.\n\n[51:15] Okay.\n\n[51:16] Well, thank you so, so much, Ed, for joining.\n\n[51:18] This was really wonderful.\n\n[51:19] I think really sparked a ton of excitement in that we're going to be able to\n\n[51:24] talk about the next few weeks.\n\n[51:26] And I think we're going to be able to talk about the next few weeks.\n\n[51:29] And I think we're going to be able to talk about the next few weeks.\n\n[51:32] Thank you so much, Ed, for your time.\n\n[51:34] It was really wonderful.\n\n[51:35] And yeah, hope you all have a rest of lovely day.\n\n[51:38] And I'll see you next week.\n\n[52:02] And we'll see you very soon."

        "transcription": "[00:00] I'm very happy to introduce Mary Lou Jepson from Open Water.\n\n[00:05] Mary Lou is developing truly revolutionary wearable devices for diagnostics and treatment\n\n[00:12] of stroke and various diseases.\n\n[00:15] Thanks.\n\n[00:16] It's fantastic to be here in person.\n\n[00:19] And Nathan, that was amazing.\n\n[00:20] Wow.\n\n[00:21] The whole conference is amazing.\n\n[00:23] Thank you, Lisa.\n\n[00:24] I'm going to talk about a wearable future for neuro.\n\n[00:28] This is my latest startup, but I started six years ago.\n\n[00:31] It was completely nuts.\n\n[00:33] But I'm going to tell you how we've been doing.\n\n[00:35] And I've reported on it on and off at these fantastic conferences.\n\n[00:39] So this is an update.\n\n[00:41] So I started the company six years ago to try to answer this question.\n\n[00:46] This is pretty personal for me.\n\n[00:49] In my 20s, I nearly died.\n\n[00:51] But I was lucky enough, as I dropped out of my physics PhD, to get empathy.\n\n[00:58] And somebody gave me an MRI scan.\n\n[00:59] And they found my brain tumor.\n\n[01:01] So I was thrilled.\n\n[01:03] Most of my friends and family were mortified.\n\n[01:05] I found a neurosurgeon, got done at the Brigham, and petitioned to get back into grad school\n\n[01:12] using the I had a brain tumor excuse, which worked.\n\n[01:16] I got the empathy vote, finished my PhD in six months, and was off and running, really\n\n[01:23] changing the visual future of display.\n\n[01:25] And so I'm a display designer, high volume consumer electronics person that's designed\n\n[01:32] your big screen TVs and projectors and virtual reality and augmented reality.\n\n[01:37] Most recently, I was executive director of engineering at Facebook Oculus, driving that\n\n[01:42] future of VR and AR.\n\n[01:44] So what the hell am I doing here?\n\n[01:46] I'm about to explain.\n\n[01:49] But really, I think of this as I along the way I found it, co-founded something called\n\n[01:54] One Laptop per Child when I was a professor here at MIT.\n\n[01:58] And we had pretty profound impact in crossing the digital divide and getting laptops to\n\n[02:04] kids and their families so that they could have access to information and be part of\n\n[02:11] the conversations.\n\n[02:12] This is a $100 laptop, works outside, works without power, still going, new kinds of battery\n\n[02:17] technology, lots of stuff in this.\n\n[02:21] And I think of what I'm trying to do at Open Water as One Laptop per Child, part two.\n\n[02:27] The vast majority of humanity still lacks access to the best diagnostics like MR, CT,\n\n[02:35] and the best therapies.\n\n[02:37] And maybe there's something that I could do with my vast consumer electronics experience\n\n[02:42] in Moore's Law to perhaps change that.\n\n[02:45] So by the way, One Laptop per Child had a lot of impact, made billions of dollars for\n\n[02:51] people, became the fastest growing consumer electronic category ever recorded, but most\n\n[02:56] importantly changed the equation of what a minister of education could do for the children\n\n[03:02] of their country.\n\n[03:03] So six years later, we have headsets.\n\n[03:07] And they're a little different than what Nathan was talking about, although we love to collaborate,\n\n[03:11] love what they're doing.\n\n[03:13] These are both diagnostic and therapeutic.\n\n[03:17] There's no drugs, no ionizing radiation.\n\n[03:21] And they use this breakthrough phase wave chip technology that we're developing at Open\n\n[03:27] Water and I'm going to talk a bit about.\n\n[03:31] Why the brain?\n\n[03:34] It's a huge problem.\n\n[03:35] There's a lot of, the last 250 drugs developed for Alzheimer's had a billion dollars a pop.\n\n[03:42] You know how many work?\n\n[03:43] Zero.\n\n[03:45] So maybe we need to look at some different approaches.\n\n[03:49] It's funny, an investor was saying most doctors don't take physics.\n\n[03:54] So physics is a really rare approach for health because they take a lot of biochemistry and\n\n[03:59] so pharma is the first choice.\n\n[04:02] So what can we do on this?\n\n[04:05] Numbers are staggering and these are the diseases we're trying to go after with our headset,\n\n[04:10] all of these.\n\n[04:11] So all of mental disease where there's 25 million people just in the U.S. alone living\n\n[04:17] with severe mental disease, six million with Alzheimer's, there's about 15K with glioblastoma,\n\n[04:23] which we think we have a good shot at.\n\n[04:25] And there's a million strokes a year.\n\n[04:26] There's more deaths due to stroke in the U.S. than COVID right now.\n\n[04:32] And that will occur every year.\n\n[04:35] And there's so little that we can do about it.\n\n[04:37] One day you're seemingly fine and the next you're dead or you don't walk again, talk\n\n[04:41] again, et cetera.\n\n[04:42] There's things we can do about it.\n\n[04:45] So how does this all work?\n\n[04:47] We use Moore's Law and these exponential technologies finally hitting the sensors and emitters like\n\n[04:56] lasers and ultrasounds that I've worked with for decades to pioneer consumer electronics.\n\n[05:03] And so what do I mean by that precisely?\n\n[05:07] The camera chip in all of your smartphone is really small.\n\n[05:11] That's because if you use less silicon area, it costs less.\n\n[05:15] So right now the camera chip in your smartphone costs a buck and has pixel sizes the size\n\n[05:22] of the wavelength of light.\n\n[05:23] And that means we can record the waves and the wavelength of light or their phase, which\n\n[05:28] gives us fundamentally more information.\n\n[05:31] And what our images look like is a lot like the water out there on the Charles.\n\n[05:35] We can read the waves and the interference patterns to extract more information as we\n\n[05:41] use light that penetrates your body.\n\n[05:44] The invention of fire was really key.\n\n[05:46] It warms us, not the light we see, but the light we don't see that warms our belly, our\n\n[05:51] rib.\n\n[05:53] And light goes right through us and we can extract information from it by recording the\n\n[05:57] phase.\n\n[05:59] The other thing we do is we craft the shape of the waves and even can steer the beams\n\n[06:06] by here you see a yellow line of emitters where the wave is delayed from one emitter\n\n[06:12] to the next emitter so that we can focus near or far or with a similar principle up, down,\n\n[06:19] left to deliver therapy wherever we wish to.\n\n[06:27] So what we built is a series of headsets that are in trials right now for diagnostics and\n\n[06:33] therapeutics and I'll talk to you about some of the diseases we're trying to get at.\n\n[06:38] Glioblastoma is a death sentence.\n\n[06:41] That's not the type of brain tumor I had by the way because I'm alive.\n\n[06:44] I had the good type.\n\n[06:46] If there is a good type.\n\n[06:49] So here you see the glioblastoma cells represented by orange spheres can hide out amid neurons\n\n[06:57] so it's almost impossible for the neurosurgeon to get the whole tumor out and it divides\n\n[07:03] really rapidly.\n\n[07:04] But we exploit something that we haven't really seen exploited in the past in aggressive cancers.\n\n[07:10] All aggressive cancers have this.\n\n[07:12] They have brittle cell membranes.\n\n[07:14] They also have larger nucleases, different cytoplasms, but the brittle cell membranes\n\n[07:19] can be exploited much like an opera singer can burst a wine glass because it's brittle\n\n[07:27] and not harm anything else in the room while it shatters that wine glass.\n\n[07:32] So we do that by applying a harmonic frequency to the glioblastoma cells so that they move.\n\n[07:41] They're like rickety ships, these fast dividing cells with the brittle cell membranes.\n\n[07:47] What we can do is then burst the glioblastoma cells and not harm any other tissue.\n\n[07:56] It's sort of like the fast dividing cells have the brittle cell membranes but none of\n\n[08:02] the other cells in your body do.\n\n[08:03] So most of your cells are sort of like the Golden Gate Bridge can withstand earthquakes\n\n[08:08] but not these.\n\n[08:09] The cool thing is that when they burst, they emit proteins that can vaccinate the brain\n\n[08:16] from the exact cancer.\n\n[08:19] So what are we doing now?\n\n[08:21] That sounds big.\n\n[08:22] So we grew a bunch of human brain organoids to try this out with real lines of glioblastoma\n\n[08:30] but the full working brain in a sub-millimeter Petri dish and applied different chemo and\n\n[08:40] our treatment.\n\n[08:42] This was the first experiment.\n\n[08:43] We're doing five times better than chemotherapy in the first experiment.\n\n[08:47] We kept going.\n\n[08:48] We've tuned the frequencies.\n\n[08:50] We ran about 200 different organoids a week and we swept through lots of frequencies,\n\n[08:55] pulse sequences, duty cycles and so forth.\n\n[08:58] And by the way, these are all diagnostic ultrasound intensities, not therapeutic.\n\n[09:05] So the FDA was like, wait, what?\n\n[09:07] Did we get that wrong?\n\n[09:09] Like lower than the doses that have been used for the last 50 years on pregnant women and\n\n[09:15] their fetuses.\n\n[09:16] So it's sort of shocking and sort of stunning.\n\n[09:20] So we finished the brain organoid studies now and we're going into mice.\n\n[09:25] We're growing glioblastoma and hopefully we can be in humans inside of the year.\n\n[09:29] It depends what the FDA says.\n\n[09:31] We'll follow all that.\n\n[09:32] But yeah, it's extremely exciting.\n\n[09:35] But that's not the first product that we're going to put on the market.\n\n[09:39] The first product has been in trials now for human testing for about a year and a half.\n\n[09:46] And it really answers this question.\n\n[09:48] Why do so many people die of stroke or are permanently dependent and disabled?\n\n[09:56] Why?\n\n[09:57] I mean, it's just a plumbing problem.\n\n[09:59] Ninety percent of the time it's a clot.\n\n[10:01] We have treatments to remove the clots.\n\n[10:03] So why do so many people die?\n\n[10:07] It's a time to diagnosis crisis.\n\n[10:11] EMT shows up.\n\n[10:13] Somebody is on the ground, on the floor slurring their words.\n\n[10:18] Are they drunk?\n\n[10:19] Are they on drugs?\n\n[10:20] Do they just fall?\n\n[10:21] Do they have a stroke?\n\n[10:22] All four are possible.\n\n[10:25] Why can't we just put an EKG on them like we can do for a heart attack and see if there's a heart attack?\n\n[10:30] Well, we can put an EKG on your forehead, but that's not going to tell you if you've got stroke.\n\n[10:34] What you want to be able to do is see right, left hemisphere blood flow difference.\n\n[10:38] And then you can get that patient, if it's in particular a large vessel occlusion, directly to a thrombectomy rather than going into the ER, waiting behind the gunshot victims, then realizing they need a scan, transferring them to another hospital.\n\n[10:57] If we can go from stroke onset to treatment within two hours, there's 90% chance of no neural deficit whatsoever for what now kills and disables permanently the majority of the victims of the large vessel severe stroke.\n\n[11:14] So how does this work?\n\n[11:16] We made a special laser that pulses.\n\n[11:18] This laser is infrared light.\n\n[11:20] And so this is, yeah, oops, can I go back?\n\n[11:27] So this, I'm showing particle theory of light here while I'm talking about phase, but this shows that the light penetrates the skin, the skull, the brain, infrared light, its heat, but it's a highly coherent heat that's pulsed.\n\n[11:42] And so we do about 100 microsecond pulse.\n\n[11:48] And so that's a lot like you're on the dance floor, the strobe light hits, it looks like you're frozen.\n\n[11:54] But if you got in and it's stretched out that time, the one thing you'd see moving is blood.\n\n[12:01] So we have a camera, that $1 camera chip from everybody's smartphone on the other side.\n\n[12:07] And what that camera chip sees is the light that goes through this arc shape.\n\n[12:12] Just by the nature of the scattering, it sees that arc.\n\n[12:15] And so what we do here is we interrogate a blood vessel, an artery.\n\n[12:20] Those are red blood cells moving.\n\n[12:22] As those red blood cells move, they make the light ricochet in different ways.\n\n[12:27] And we see that the way the waves are interfering on the camera chip.\n\n[12:32] And we read that much like a sailor can read the waves out in the water and know where the fish are and know where the land is.\n\n[12:40] We use Fourier transforms and stuff like that and are able to figure out what's moving.\n\n[12:45] The spatial frequency changes, the contrast changes.\n\n[12:48] And we read that with extraordinary precision.\n\n[12:51] We can see blood flow and blood volume.\n\n[12:54] So here's what we can see.\n\n[12:56] We can even see the boom boom of your heart.\n\n[12:59] And we see these patterns.\n\n[13:01] So this is the camera image and we decode it.\n\n[13:05] And it looks something like this.\n\n[13:07] We put these modules on different parts of your brain.\n\n[13:10] We look at in the case of our large vessel occlusion detector, the ACA, the middle cerebral artery is superior and inferior.\n\n[13:17] Those are the big branches off of the carotid and where the worst type stroke come from.\n\n[13:23] So we do that and we get these images of right, left hemisphere blood flow difference.\n\n[13:29] This person needs a thrombectomy.\n\n[13:32] And so we don't expect the EMT to read this.\n\n[13:35] What we envision instead is a cell phone interface that tells the doctor, hey, get ready, a thrombectomy is coming in.\n\n[13:44] The stroke doctors know more about when their Uber Eats order is coming than when they're getting somebody who's losing 1.8 million neurons a minute with a severe stroke.\n\n[13:56] So they can start prepping the cath lab.\n\n[13:59] So they can basically, the solution for this, it really is plumbing, is snaking a catheter up, pieces of steel will pull out.\n\n[14:05] I mean, it's more complicated than that, but not really.\n\n[14:10] So, you know, the person just needs the clot removed and we can make that happen faster.\n\n[14:15] So, again, if we can change that from stroke onset to thrombectomy, even the worst case of large vessel occlusion, we can go from the majority of people being dead or dependent, like not walking again, not talking again, not having a job again, maybe not going home again, to a 90 percent chance of no neural deficit whatsoever.\n\n[14:38] So that's what we're working on.\n\n[14:40] So with different resonant frequencies, though, like the miglioblastoma, we can excite neurons or suppress neurons.\n\n[14:49] So we're starting some trials on severe depression and OCD, severe depression won this year, so that we can stimulate neurons.\n\n[14:59] I mean, a lot of things cause mental disease, but one of the end results is either the neurons are firing too much or not enough.\n\n[15:06] And so we can address that at different harmonic frequencies.\n\n[15:10] And we're working also on Alzheimer's with different harmonic frequencies that seem to do, and this is the earliest, there's some published research on it, that shows synaptogenesis and neurogenesis.\n\n[15:22] So here's a bit on that. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is used and direct current stimulation, but we can focus energy anywhere we wish to in the brain.\n\n[15:37] We're not stuck with a two centimeter depth, and we can control the intensity quite precisely.\n\n[15:45] And these intensities are, again, diagnostic level.\n\n[15:49] They're below the 100 percent mechanical index used for that.\n\n[15:55] So that's pretty cool.\n\n[15:57] So here we are. We've been in humans for a while now for stroke, and we're scaling up those trials.\n\n[16:03] We're starting in humans in a neuro stimulation this fall via NRB at University of Arizona.\n\n[16:13] And on the glioblastoma, we're going into mice and hoping to be in humans once we walk through that.\n\n[16:20] So they're really big problems with very little solutions.\n\n[16:24] We're trying to look at our technology and apply them to large human unmet needs.\n\n[16:29] And here's an impressive and growing array of clinical partners using our devices.\n\n[16:36] We're really it's amazing how we track the manufacturing trends because we're using low cost components that can be made in the silicon fabs of the world.\n\n[16:46] The fabs that I've lived and breathed and shipped high volume consumer electronics for decades now.\n\n[16:52] So here's a summary.\n\n[16:57] Basically, it's new hardware and software technology, diagnostics and therapeutics.\n\n[17:04] And we're trying to accelerate. It's delight to be here.\n\n[17:07] And thank you very much for listening.\n\n[17:15] Are there any questions? Sure. Hi. Thank you. That was great.\n\n[17:22] Can you help me understand? I understand how you're looking at light scatter to look at from a diagnostic point of view.\n\n[17:29] Can you help me understand how you achieve neuronal excitation through the harmonic distribution of light?\n\n[17:36] We're using sound in that case. So low frequency ultrasound with phased array.\n\n[17:45] Sorry, I didn't make that clear. And thanks for the question.\n\n[17:49] Yeah.\n\n[18:00] It's interesting. It depends what you throw at it. I showed live on stage at Ted a few years ago, focusing to a micron.\n\n[18:07] But that was combining light and sound.\n\n[18:11] And so we could see a single neuron firing in practice.\n\n[18:17] We can do sub millimeter. We haven't looked at a need for more, but it depends what your needs are.\n\n[18:27] Oh, it's phased array. Phased array.\n\n[18:31] And we also compensate for the skull, which isn't, you know, a suma spherical cow.\n\n[18:38] So we would take a scan data and compensate for and so we look at the FMRI data to decide where in the case of, say, depression, we deliver the radiation.\n\n[18:51] So this tracks on transcranial magnetic stimulation and and TDCS.\n\n[18:58] But it just it's a wearable steerable solution at very low intensity that we're starting.\n\n[19:06] We're starting trials. We'll have more data next time we present.\n\n[19:10] But it seems very promising compared to the limitations of the other systems.\n\n[19:17] And that it also can be a consumer product or at least use at home eventually.\n\n[19:25] Any other questions? Good.\n\n[19:28] So it's my great honor. Lisa told me I got to do something really cool.\n\n[19:33] It is time for lunch, which is right outside. And please go get it.\n\n[19:37] I'm sure it's really delicious. And thank you so much."

    "Increasing Healthy Human Lifespan, Laura Deming of The Longevity Fund": {
        "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtGlblrBMCU",
        "transcription": "[00:00] So Laura, why now in terms of longevity? What's happened to make you raise a fund and start\n\n[00:06] investing in research and companies? Yeah, so we think this is an insanely important\n\n[00:13] part of the story because if you were Aristotle and you were like trying to start a longevity fund,\n\n[00:18] you would have a terrible time and be like, you know, the worst idea. And so timing is super\n\n[00:25] important. Like why now for the first time in like 2000, 3000 years is it the correct time to\n\n[00:31] work on longevity? To us, a lot of that comes back to tooling and what's available for us to use.\n\n[00:39] Prior to the 1900s, if you wanted to impact biology, maybe you should have been a physicist,\n\n[00:46] worked on optics, helped make the first microscope. And like Robert Hooke, a physicist,\n\n[00:50] you know, discovers the cell. So, you know, there's so much that comes from physics and other\n\n[00:55] disciplines into biology to push it forward. But then I think in the 1900s, something kind of\n\n[01:00] fascinating happens, which is that for the first time, there's kind of this acceleration of tooling,\n\n[01:04] right? X-rays, NMR, all these things, you know, the cathode ray tube discovered, mass spectrometry,\n\n[01:09] but, you know, by this guy trying to find the mass of the electron, which is so cool. And so all these\n\n[01:15] physics tools are, you know, coming online, but then also more biology-driven tools. And so really\n\n[01:20] I think, you know, and we can get into this more specifically maybe later time, but kind of what's\n\n[01:24] excited us is just seeing the tools available to characterize life become available for the first\n\n[01:30] time ever, right? You know, for all millennia, you had Darwin and Mendel talk about genetics,\n\n[01:35] and there was no knowledge of what was actually going on at the ground truth level. And in 1953,\n\n[01:39] for the first time, you have the link between molecular biology and what we're looking at with\n\n[01:44] microscopes and genetics and this sort of concept of freddy, which is just super exciting.\n\n[01:50] And what caused you to jump in?\n\n[01:52] Well, I mean, A, I think I was born in like a very lucky time, right? I think you always have to be\n\n[01:57] sort of cautious or like, I guess, like a little bit concerned if you believe that about yourself,\n\n[02:00] right? Like, why now? Like, you know, should it really be the lucky time? But then I think also,\n\n[02:04] you know, as a kid, or A, just like had a lot of relatives that were, you know, sort of aging,\n\n[02:08] and that was very striking, but also, you know, really wanted to solve cancer. And I was, I\n\n[02:13] remember talking to my dad about this, and I was like, oh, like, I want to solve cancer. And he's\n\n[02:16] like, well, you know, cancer is a subset of aging. So if you want to solve cancer, you just like,\n\n[02:19] you know, solve aging and like, takes care of all these other things as well. And that just, you\n\n[02:23] know, that coupled with kind of like hanging off my grandma's were like, that just kind of made\n\n[02:26] sense to me as a kid. I was like, okay, well, like, you know, guess I'll go solve aging then.\n\n[02:29] Like, that's the biggest problem. Because cancer is not the number one cause of death in the US,\n\n[02:33] right? It's heart disease, something like that. Right. Well, you know, just like, if you look at\n\n[02:36] all the HLA diseases, you know, past this certain point are driving kind of like the majority of\n\n[02:41] sort of natural deaths, so to speak. So, you know, like, once we got rid of infectious disease,\n\n[02:45] like it really became the case like aging, which wasn't previously like necessarily the biggest\n\n[02:49] issue, sort of like rose to the forefront. Yeah. And so that kind of, I mean, it sort of just,\n\n[02:54] I think made sense to like a small trials that that was important. Huh. And so why raise a fund\n\n[02:59] rather than, you know, just go for curing cancer? So the thinking at the time was, you know,\n\n[03:05] possibly in a good way, like Emperor has no clothes, like extremely simplistic. Like,\n\n[03:08] you have to understand, so I was at MIT and I was like a sophomore. Yeah. And I was also 16.\n\n[03:13] And I had like maybe a thousand dollars in my bank account. And so like, you know, knowledge\n\n[03:17] about like the financial industry, like relatively low. My dad had been a public investor, so I kind\n\n[03:20] of knew a lot about like the idea of investing in things like that. That was a generally good\n\n[03:23] thing to do. And I'd worked in like aging labs for maybe four years. And I think the striking\n\n[03:28] thing was just like there was just like no money to like make drugs. And it's kind of hard, you\n\n[03:33] know, like when you're in a lab, you just have like no idea what's going on in the outside world.\n\n[03:37] And so I would like ask venture capitalists, like I would, you know, call up a few in the phone book\n\n[03:40] and like, you know, a few responded. And so like have these like random conversations and just be\n\n[03:44] like, you know, I'm just curious. I'm a student. Can you like tell me more about like how this\n\n[03:48] industry works? Like, you know, are you funding aging therapeutics? And like none of them had heard\n\n[03:52] of like aging therapeutics. They were kind of like Asian therapeutics. Like what did you say?\n\n[03:58] And so that was just very striking that like something that I personally believe, like on the\n\n[04:02] technology, like not just like from a mission perspective, like on the technology side was like\n\n[04:06] super exciting was kind of generally not really like looked at a lot by these folks who are\n\n[04:10] supposedly like the great translators of technology. And then I think also it kind of made sense,\n\n[04:15] like, you know, the first ever mutation found to really extend the lifespan was 1983. The next was\n\n[04:20] like 1993. And so really the field started about like 20, 30 years ago. It's like kind of made sense\n\n[04:24] like if you think about like how long it takes for a field to like get traction and like become known,\n\n[04:28] like, okay, there may be like less than a hundred good labs in this space. Maybe like people just\n\n[04:32] haven't had enough time on like the venture or like investment side to understand that this is\n\n[04:36] like really cool and important. And so like then it kind of made sense that like you might want to\n\n[04:40] start a fund if that were the case, like help more drugs going to get started out of the space.\n\n[04:44] Hmm. So in other words, like the big pharmaceutical companies are not investing in these pilot ideas.\n\n[04:49] They weren't at the time. So things are really-\n\n[04:51] So this was like five years ago or something? Yeah.\n\n[04:52] Seven years ago. Yeah. So things have really changed. You know, seven years ago, there were\n\n[04:55] like maybe like three companies have been started or so that had like the aging brand on them.\n\n[04:59] There was like zero people interested like Arch Ventures was one of the few that were like taking\n\n[05:03] risks. There's like maybe 10 million invested like that year in total of like the space,\n\n[05:07] right? And like in the past four years, we've had like 10 billion plus. We now see like 300\n\n[05:11] companies per year. So it's just really changed. Like it's very, very striking to have watch it go\n\n[05:15] from like zero to like what it is today. Yeah. Now it's totally a trend. Hopefully it sticks\n\n[05:20] around. So you have not a million, but many questions for you. I think like on top of the\n\n[05:26] list for me is what you do personally. Yes. This is probably the most common question.\n\n[05:32] And I think all my friends will always say that I answer this terribly because I, you know,\n\n[05:36] I'm kind of like, you know, I come from a semi-scientific background and so like we like to\n\n[05:40] get like to the ground truth of things and it's just really hard. Like there's just like a million,\n\n[05:45] if you start reading mouse size and longevity, like you will find mouse size that say like if\n\n[05:48] you decrease like they've done this like really cool experiment where you take fat and sugar and\n\n[05:54] protein and you decrease the level of each of them and keep a total calorie intake the same,\n\n[05:58] you can kind of test like which component of diet is like contributing to longevity.\n\n[06:02] And they did this and they like did kind of like a full matrix and they'd like life span studies\n\n[06:05] for each of like the different proportions. And what they found from that study in mice was that\n\n[06:09] like decreasing protein was the number one kind of thing that increased longevity. And so from\n\n[06:14] that you might infer like maybe less protein is good, but at the same time, it doesn't seem like,\n\n[06:18] you know, maybe if you work out a lot, that would be different. And so I've come to the conclusion\n\n[06:22] that kind of like, you know, I have some theses about like what is good and what is not good.\n\n[06:26] But it just as a scientist, it's really hard to say that there's kind of like a good kind of like\n\n[06:30] real kind of like hypothesis there. Okay. And so I'm sure like not a lot of like,\n\n[06:35] despite like reading probably more papers on this than like most people in the world,\n\n[06:40] it really is something where I don't see things that I think are extremely clear kind of like\n\n[06:47] movers for longevity on like the diet level, obviously that like aren't confounded by other\n\n[06:51] things. So what's your diet? Well, I've tried a variety of things. I think right now it's just\n\n[06:57] kind of like the sort of like bare minimal, like try to eat low sugar. Personally, trying low protein\n\n[07:04] just because I think that is somewhat supported by kind of like literature. Yeah. And low protein\n\n[07:09] is like a gram per kilogram per day. I think just sort of like not it's a good question. It's like,\n\n[07:18] what is the correct per person? Also, if you exercise. I actually once tried to calculate out\n\n[07:23] if you exercise like how much protein would be required to like replenish like all of your\n\n[07:27] myosin and actin proteins. Yeah. And it's kind of fascinating. I think that there might actually be\n\n[07:30] like up to a hundredfold increase in power like in your muscles where like if they all fired at the\n\n[07:35] same time, you get like sort of a lot of power. But I mean, I don't have any strong recommendations\n\n[07:42] on diet. Like I really like I read basically all the studies and I think maybe low protein, low sugar,\n\n[07:48] are both good. Like intermittent fasting seems to be like somewhat supported. Are you doing that?\n\n[07:53] I've tried it. I think it's kind of hard to maintain if you like, you know, have a\n\n[07:56] graduating sleep cycle. But yeah, I wish I had better recommendations for that area.\n\n[08:03] Okay. And in terms of supplements, you doing anything?\n\n[08:06] There's a variety of people who recommend everything from NAD plus all the way through\n\n[08:09] to like Metformin for the kind of the more adventurous. I think that so we actually have\n\n[08:14] a secret list at the fund of like on market drugs and things that we think based on like our\n\n[08:19] like body of evidence might be having an impact on lifespan and we're monitoring them. Some of them,\n\n[08:24] I personally think would be like intriguing to take. We don't release that list just because\n\n[08:27] we were afraid that if we did and kind of like somebody acted on it and kind of like didn't work\n\n[08:31] out well for them, that should be like a terrible thing to do to like them. But we have a secret\n\n[08:35] list of things that we think are like interesting. Okay. And I think for the NAD plus though,\n\n[08:39] there's some evidence of like positive effect there, but we haven't seen great\n\n[08:42] lifespan studies showing like a large increase in lifespan. So that'd be like my one concern\n\n[08:45] there. Okay, cool. Because yeah, in the worm and mouse studies, there have been like, you know,\n\n[08:51] a hundred percent increase in lifespan, right? So worm studies, we've gotten up to tenfold reported,\n\n[08:58] you know, possibly more. That's by decreasing a gene product though. So that's kind of like,\n\n[09:03] if you want to go and take a gene therapy or we had such a thing, you know, from birth,\n\n[09:08] possibly like that would work. But probably the effect would be a lot smaller. In mice,\n\n[09:12] we've got about up to a twofold increase and that was a combination of a mutation and restricting\n\n[09:17] the total clork intake of the mouse. Okay. Down to what? I don't remember for that study. On\n\n[09:23] average, I think people will do CR to about 30% of normal clork intake, but it really varies. So\n\n[09:28] if you take 40 different, and this is where it gets complicated. You take 40 different, genetically\n\n[09:33] different strains of mice and you change their diet in the same way, half will live shorter\n\n[09:38] and half will live longer. And so, you know, I used to, as a kid, I was always like, oh, you know,\n\n[09:42] like there's a simple answer. And I think that there is, but I think it is a lot more sort of\n\n[09:47] reliant on genetics and other things than we'd like to think. How long have your family members\n\n[09:55] lived? How long have my family members lived? Your grandparents, great grandparents. Well,\n\n[10:00] my grandma is still going. She's in her mid nineties. It's a good sign. Yes, exactly. So\n\n[10:05] they've all lived, you know, about age 80 or above. So, you know, hopefully,\n\n[10:09] how about yourself? How long is your family? Not 90. So yeah, we'll see how it goes. I need\n\n[10:14] it more than you. Right. What would you say the number one health hack that you'd recommend to\n\n[10:20] your audience would be? I mean, well, I mean, I've done a little bit of blood work, so everything's\n\n[10:25] kind of anecdotal and based on feel. Yeah. But I was vegetarian for eight years. Oh, interesting.\n\n[10:33] For environmental reasons. And then I realized that I had like developed this entire vocabulary\n\n[10:39] around cheating. So, for example, if I was traveling, it was like cultural meat and it was\n\n[10:45] allowed. And then, you know, if I was like, you know, over your house and like you made chicken\n\n[10:50] or something, I'd be like, whatever, I'll have it. I see. And at the point it was like twice a\n\n[10:54] month. I was like, I'm not vegetarian anymore. So I started eating more protein, but really just\n\n[10:59] more eggs. And then I felt a lot better. But really the main thing is sleep. Like, yeah,\n\n[11:04] prioritizing that. That makes sense. I will say that actually one thing that's interesting on the\n\n[11:08] health plan front, I think people have this like intuition that when they feel better, that's a\n\n[11:12] metric for something that's good for them. Yeah. I think it's actually not true. So if you look\n\n[11:17] like a lot to some extent, like, you know, maybe you want to optimize like robust, very cheerful\n\n[11:22] lifespan, in which case, like, like tautologically it is. Yeah. But most of the time or a lot of the\n\n[11:27] time when you see our mice or you do other things like make them live longer, so total number of\n\n[11:31] years increases, they're not kind of like as happy on a day to day basis, like a little bit thinner,\n\n[11:35] a little bit more lethargic in some cases. So I think it's kind of like, you know, whenever someone\n\n[11:38] says like, I really feel better because I'm doing X, I'm always like, oh gosh, like, I wonder if\n\n[11:41] that's like the correct thing. Like maybe, maybe not. Hard to say. When people talk about health\n\n[11:45] span in my mind, it's very correlated to how I feel. Right. If I was going to do caloric\n\n[11:50] restriction and every day would suck for 90 years, I would opt out. I mean, I don't know\n\n[11:56] if there's a drug. I, for instance, like, I know a lot of people who have experimented with like\n\n[12:00] keto and other random diets and they're just caffeinated to the gills. Like, there's low energy.\n\n[12:07] That's so funny. That's one thing you can do. Oh my gosh. Yeah, that's hilarious. Yeah. So I don't\n\n[12:12] know. But one thing I've been curious about, like, there seems to be relatively limited data on actual\n\n[12:18] humans. Yes. So how, how might someone set up a study? Is it even possible now or is everything\n\n[12:25] so regulated? There is this fellow in your bar's light who's working on what's called the TAME\n\n[12:28] trial. And the point of that is to assay the effects of this drug, but form, which is a very\n\n[12:33] old diabetes drug on sort of markers or biomarkers of aging that he has kind of like put forward.\n\n[12:40] And the cost for that will be about $61 million. And if people do it, the idea would be, okay,\n\n[12:44] well, here's our first pass at testing aging in humans. And so finally we have some more data.\n\n[12:49] The way that trial was sort of motivated was there was this kind of large finding that in\n\n[12:55] hundreds of thousands of patients, or I think about actually 70,000 in that population from kind of\n\n[12:59] like a UK study. If you look retrospectively, people who had been taking med 4-1 for decades,\n\n[13:03] they had apparently like a little bit better kind of health span. So they had less HLA disease.\n\n[13:09] The diabetics did on this drug, even then they're kind of like non-diabetic counterparts who were\n\n[13:13] not taking that form in. And so I think that hard to say that studies like definitive evidence,\n\n[13:18] but that kind of motivated all this sort of question asking of, could we really nail down\n\n[13:23] in humans a trial to like test, you know, met form in particular. That said, you know, I think that\n\n[13:29] a lot of biologists will really kind of say, oh, it's very important to test things in humans. And\n\n[13:32] of course it is, if we could do that, we would be doing it kind of all over the place.\n\n[13:36] But I think increasingly over the years, and maybe it's just like I started out in worm biology,\n\n[13:40] I'm kind of like more and more excited about like the animal kingdom. Like, you know, the animal\n\n[13:44] kingdom is just like absolutely awesome. Like we have one company in our current sort of, you know,\n\n[13:48] sort of portfolio that's working on this and they're amazing, you know, fauna. But kind of like,\n\n[13:54] there's such diversity of phenotypes, right? And like, how can we learn from other animals\n\n[13:58] as opposed to just like our lowly selves? Because like, you know, for example, there's naked mole\n\n[14:02] rats and rats, right? Like naked mole rats are pushing 30 on lifespan. Like we have no idea how\n\n[14:06] long they live. Like their mortality rate at 30 is not going up. So we're just like watching these\n\n[14:10] guys like waiting for them to start dying. And then like rats, which have like very similar\n\n[14:13] physiology, live maybe like three to four years. And so what on earth is different between these\n\n[14:18] two animals, right? Like that's just absolutely fascinating. I think it's also important because\n\n[14:23] like, you know, a lot of like, you know, physicists and mathematicians that I used to be this way,\n\n[14:27] like we're always worried, what are those like inherent like limitation on like the complexity\n\n[14:31] level? Like what if given a certain complex system, a certain rate of metabolism, like\n\n[14:35] you have to die because there's some kind of like, you know, sort of theory about like entropy\n\n[14:39] increasing over time and that like, you know, must drive and just like too complex like really\n\n[14:42] intervene. But then like, you know, these animals are basically the same size, like have so like\n\n[14:47] so many other similarities. Like it would just be very hard to maintain like that theory and also\n\n[14:51] accept this kind of like large differential longevity. Yeah, absolutely. So someone asked\n\n[14:55] a question that I thought was kind of funny. Yeah, here we go. So Micah asks, basically,\n\n[15:00] do you think immortality is going to be achieved by curing all diseases? So in other words, like\n\n[15:05] living forever or like what's going to happen first that or are we going to just upload our\n\n[15:10] consciousness to a computer and live forever that way? I think that so that that was a question that\n\n[15:17] I used to get very interested in sort of like, well, you know, if you really care about this,\n\n[15:21] like you're working on kind of like the biology. Yeah, where do you work? Yeah, exactly. I think\n\n[15:24] so the way the way I kind of think about it, which is not a good answer, but it's kind of\n\n[15:27] a framework for thinking about this question is I think about biology like a set of tools, right?\n\n[15:32] So you can kind of see this in like the kind of like things that have become available recently\n\n[15:38] for us to use to affect human health. What I mean by that is like, you know, prior to like,\n\n[15:44] you know, the 1900s or like even like just the 1980s or maybe like the 1930s,\n\n[15:49] like the first time you look at this marker, if you wanted to make a drug, it was like a small\n\n[15:52] molecule, right? It was like you got a plant, you found something from a plant that was useful.\n\n[15:55] Or you like put some salt on a wound, which we realized that's a bad idea. Don't do that.\n\n[15:59] Not very good for sterility. There are things you would do. But then like, you know, in the\n\n[16:04] 20th century, for the first time, we use like proteins, you know, insulin or antibodies created\n\n[16:10] by like our own bodies or the bodies of like the mice that like we kind of cloned them in\n\n[16:14] to treat disease. And so we actually use something that came from life to treat,\n\n[16:18] you know, kind of like a living organism. We now just in the past kind of three years have like\n\n[16:22] landmark approvals and viruses being used to like blow up cancer, literally, like these are called\n\n[16:26] oncolytic viruses. There's new drugs using genetically engineered cells. You've probably\n\n[16:32] heard of, you know, CAR-T and kind of like this whole kind of, you know, oncology phenomenon,\n\n[16:35] also stem cells being used. And so I think kind of like the final frontier of all of that,\n\n[16:39] like use of kind of like biology's own system to do cool stuff is the brain understanding kind of\n\n[16:43] like that system. But I think to lead up to that, you kind of will do so many things that it may be\n\n[16:47] the case that like we kind of get there at the same time, right? So, you know, like that's like\n\n[16:50] the final frontier and we solve it, but kind of like along the way, we've also kind of like done\n\n[16:53] enough work on the other tooling kind of fronts that we get to kind of like to a kind of, you know,\n\n[16:58] maybe we don't solve kind of like lifespan itself, but like longevity is definitely impacted by kind\n\n[17:02] of like the work up to that time. Right, exactly. And do you sense that there's like a strong signal\n\n[17:07] at this point as to what might be the way that we, you know, a bunch of people ask these questions,\n\n[17:12] but like, you know, increasing lifespan, like 20%. Like, if you had to put money on it, obviously,\n\n[17:18] you literally put money on it. Yes. What would be the most likely thing to take off?\n\n[17:24] The most likely thing to take off in the next 50 years. So here's how we think about it. Like,\n\n[17:30] we have extremely strong confidence that it's possible to impact lifespan between like, you\n\n[17:35] know, three months to maybe 10 years. Yeah. And, you know, obviously like, you know, different\n\n[17:39] probabilities with what we have to in fact, we're pretty certain that there are some things in the\n\n[17:44] clinic already or on the market that with some probability are impacting lifespan. Like lifespan\n\n[17:50] seems to be very malleable, you know, to a small degree. I think the larger question is like, well,\n\n[17:55] you know, A, how many of those can you like put together to like get kind of the maximum impact\n\n[18:00] from like that first wave? And then B, our thesis is that none of those things will be sufficient\n\n[18:06] on their own to result in like an engineered lifespan. So you have this first wave of things\n\n[18:09] that like kind of work, but like they're kind of limited. Like they have kind of like a maybe like\n\n[18:13] 60%. And that's like the max. So then the question is like, how can you like go above that?\n\n[18:18] And we think that really all comes back to tooling. And so that's where I don't know if I'm,\n\n[18:21] you know, we're Aristotle or kind of like we're like Newton or like maybe like in the best case\n\n[18:25] scenario, we're like Einstein or like, you know, of someone today in the realm of physics in terms\n\n[18:29] like going to the moon, like you've tried to go to the moon and kind of like 1600s would be a\n\n[18:32] little bit hard. More recently, maybe a little bit easier. But like, I think that's where we have\n\n[18:37] some hope and optimism, but we're not as confident that there are things today that we'd point you\n\n[18:40] to say that's going to result in kind of like unbounded engineered ability to kind of like\n\n[18:44] impact longevity. And that's why we also really care about tools when we think about like investing\n\n[18:48] in the space, not just kind of the first wave of like awesome therapies that will be available\n\n[18:51] sooner, but like maybe aren't as kind of like engineerable. Right. So you're kind of hedging\n\n[18:55] if this is still foundational stage. Right. Exactly. I think we'd love to think that it is.\n\n[19:00] And like, yeah, like 1953, my argument for foundational stage would be like, this is the\n\n[19:04] first time ever in history that we have the link between genetics and microbiology. Like that happened\n\n[19:08] in 1953. That's pretty landmark. Maybe it's been 70 years. You're like, well, what happened in 70?\n\n[19:12] Couldn't it just have happened like right after 1953? But I think that'd be the argument for like,\n\n[19:15] that's why today makes sense from like engineering perspective. Okay.\n\n[19:20] And then ethically, you know, Ryan Hoover asked like about the ethics of longevity. Another,\n\n[19:26] Jack Fernandez asked like, people want to actually want to live longer.\n\n[19:31] Do you have strong opinions on this or are you kind of stepping back?\n\n[19:34] So we get asked about this all the time. And it was funny because when I started the\n\n[19:38] fund, I never thought that people would ask those questions. Yeah. Because to me, the reason-\n\n[19:42] You thought it was assumed. Well, because the reason we started the fund was to cure like\n\n[19:45] things like cancer and Alzheimer's. And so like from our perspective, it was like, well, you know,\n\n[19:49] like you would never ask like, is it good to cure cancer? Like no one would ever ask that question\n\n[19:52] that I've heard of, or maybe some people would. But then we realized that like when people think\n\n[19:56] longevity, they think about it as different than those things. And so I think like, you know,\n\n[19:59] from our perspective, like I just, you know, I think it makes sense to cure like these diseases\n\n[20:04] if we can. And so we definitely wanted to do that. And so like, you know, we would never deviate from\n\n[20:10] kind of our mission. I think, you know, from a broader scale, it's kind of like two camps. So\n\n[20:13] like, do you want to be like Malthusian? And you're thinking of kind of like, you know, the world is\n\n[20:16] like a bounded place. Like, you know, it's really like limited resources or like kind of like David\n\n[20:20] Deutchian, like, you know, like, you know, we're on, you know, spaceship Earth, but like, no,\n\n[20:23] we're not to actually like, let's go and like explore the cosmos and kind of like unlimited\n\n[20:26] resources and energies like in all matter. I think like just like kind of like from a\n\n[20:31] like philosophical standpoint, I'm more on the kind of the latter sort of camp. I like that kind\n\n[20:35] of viewpoint a little bit better. But yeah, I think to us, like just the like the rationale for\n\n[20:40] longevity really was let's cure age-related diseases. How do you do that? You work on aging.\n\n[20:43] Hmm. And yeah, maybe there are multiple universes where we live. I'm trying to get David on the\n\n[20:49] podcast. I met him one time when we talked about it. Really? Yeah. Would you have to like go to him\n\n[20:55] and his house? That's what I did when I met him. That would be the best interview ever. Yeah,\n\n[21:01] he did one with Sam Harris. That was kind of cool. Oh, my gosh. But but really, like in terms of\n\n[21:07] having an actual opinion on this. So there was a cool one on the ethics. Mike asked, how would\n\n[21:12] immortality change society? Wouldn't we become more complacent since we have to quote forever to do\n\n[21:18] things? Wouldn't that diminish our rate of innovation? And since less new individuals\n\n[21:23] are being created, we would have less access to new ideas. In other words, like there are fewer\n\n[21:28] Newtons, fewer Einsteins. And sort of this is like why the basic income argument or one of the basic\n\n[21:33] income arguments, right? Right. We allow for these people to succeed. Well, so I think there are two\n\n[21:38] implicit assumptions there. One is that we understand how people are motivated and that\n\n[21:42] their motivation stems from this feeling that like they will die. Yeah. And I think number two is\n\n[21:46] this idea that like people have an innate kind of rate of loss of new ideas of age, kind of innate\n\n[21:52] loss of openness. And so I think addressing both of those on the first point, I think they're kind\n\n[21:58] of all questions. I don't think that that's true personally. I don't think that I'm motivated to\n\n[22:05] do things because I know that I'm going to die. I think that perhaps everyone else is, and this is\n\n[22:10] just kind of a personal thing, but I think I'm motivated by many things like curiosity, competition,\n\n[22:14] sort of like personal growth, kind of like wanting to be better next year than like was today, kind\n\n[22:20] of like a sense of mission and importance, kind of like it's important to go do certain things.\n\n[22:25] I think if you ask most people, maybe they'd have different answers, but I'm curious if death\n\n[22:31] really is like the core kind of like motivator to do things for everyone in the world. That's one\n\n[22:36] thing. And my result is a few people wanting to go to war, which might be problematic if you kind\n\n[22:40] of like want more war and more soldiers, or not if you would like less war. That would be an\n\n[22:45] interesting thing. But I think for that question, I don't agree that we really understand like the\n\n[22:49] core motivation of everyone on this planet and that that is by definition the fear of death.\n\n[22:55] I think the other thing that's interesting is sort of to the second point,\n\n[23:00] the question of like loss of ideas with age. There is a lot of like just cognitive like\n\n[23:05] change with age, which is very fascinating, right? And sort of like biologically you do change.\n\n[23:10] And like part of what we really want to do is impact aging, but like a large part of it,\n\n[23:15] we can just make a cognitive enhancer. So you were like sharp until you're nine and then you\n\n[23:18] dropped. That would be equally like that would also be like an awesome product in and of itself.\n\n[23:22] Just cognitive enhancement alone would be great. And so I think actually people kind of like\n\n[23:27] undercounting the value of potentially if you're a Newton, absolutely brilliant. And you help\n\n[23:32] develop a field and maintain your 20 year old openness and kind of like fluidity for 100 years,\n\n[23:36] all the way through to age 90. Like what insane kind of ideas with Newton becoming up with at\n\n[23:40] age 90, like with that kind of openness. The counter argument there was like, well, he would\n\n[23:44] just go into alchemy and something you have like, you know, young Newton being great and then like\n\n[23:47] older Newton like doing alchemy. The counter argument is like, well, maybe alchemy like caused\n\n[23:50] a decline in thinking because like he was sniffing too much mercury. So I don't want to counter.\n\n[23:54] Yeah, you almost won an argument for like outsider scientists who don't get discovered until they die\n\n[24:00] and then they have like 100 years of portfolio. Right. And they're also just, I mean, like so many\n\n[24:06] people, like, you know, some incredible physicists at Stanford who are still amazing and coming with\n\n[24:10] extremely novel ideas and like, you know, Hawking publishing on like black holes and entropy,\n\n[24:14] right? Like this final paper, like on this completely novel, fascinating field.\n\n[24:18] And like, was that like, you know, was he declining? Would we like Hawking to kind of like step aside\n\n[24:22] for like the younger generation? Like, can't we have both? I guess would be a question.\n\n[24:26] Interesting. So would you be a proponent of like, you know, giving the entire or like\n\n[24:31] somewhat like fluoride in the water, putting like provigil in the water?\n\n[24:35] I think that I'm never a fan of things that don't involve individual choice.\n\n[24:38] So anything that like would be sort of coercive or kind of like enforcement, then like, no.\n\n[24:42] But I mean, so if everyone would sign up for it, then like, I do think that, you know, there's\n\n[24:46] like all this fascinating work on cognitive enhancement, like just starting to come out today.\n\n[24:50] And that's a, we've seen a lot of companies that we're super excited about that have to do with\n\n[24:53] kind of like, you know, making your neurons kind of like make more sign-ins, increasing the like\n\n[24:57] rate of division or, you know, hypothetically, I think that aerosol is a bit contentious, but,\n\n[25:01] you know, like that to us is kind of like, that's part of longevity. If we just had a\n\n[25:05] pill for like cognitive enhancement, you know, that in itself would be like absolutely wonderful.\n\n[25:10] Like limitless.\n\n[25:11] Yeah. I mean, everything I've tried, I think it's, yeah, it works. There are some times where you\n\n[25:18] get this feeling that you're, you know, you're really good at like your crush and email, but\n\n[25:21] you're not the most creative and you're just like sweating the whole day.\n\n[25:25] Not coming up with the deep thoughts. Yeah. It's actually fascinating. I remember this book,\n\n[25:29] Daily Habits. I would actually, I think you might like it. It's the daily habits of mostly writers\n\n[25:34] and artists, but it's super fascinating because the details kind of like how they live their life.\n\n[25:38] And it's just extremely variable. But the most common thing is that they all wake up and go to\n\n[25:42] sleep. They have a very set routine. And when they wake up, do work and go to sleep.\n\n[25:45] I'm already on that cycle. Yeah. I mean, what a thing I have found is that my\n\n[25:53] mornings are just much more valuable than my evenings. Especially in the middle of the day,\n\n[25:57] like I'm just kind of useless. So I just work out at like two in the afternoon.\n\n[26:01] I'm curious why that is. Like it's either biological or psychological, right? Sort of like,\n\n[26:05] you know, you get like too much loaded into your brain and you don't want to think.\n\n[26:08] Or it'd be really fascinating if sleep played a key role there. I would sort of like sleep does\n\n[26:12] something biologically and perhaps psychologically that like somehow induces like an optimal state,\n\n[26:16] like right when you wake up. But yeah. Have you tried it? Like sleeping in the middle of the day\n\n[26:21] and then just getting back to work? I haven't, but that's an interesting idea. I'm curious what that\n\n[26:25] would do. Possible. Interesting. Yeah. I'm so curious about cognitive enhancement. We did a\n\n[26:31] podcast with Rosalind Watts, who is at Imperial about psychedelics. Oh, that's awesome.\n\n[26:36] Where it's awesome. I mean, it's, it's very similar. Actually her research with Robin Carhart\n\n[26:43] Harris at Imperial is in Michael Pollan's book. Oh, interesting. No, I did. I've heard so much\n\n[26:47] about it though. It's really great. But I mean, it's kind of like cognitive enhancement in a very\n\n[26:52] broad sense in terms of like trying to break you out of your old habits and like have more confidence.\n\n[26:58] Increase openness and yeah, exactly. And so are you, are you taking anything to like any in the\n\n[27:04] nootropic sense? No, I think I don't even do caffeine because the general thought is like try\n\n[27:11] to wean yourself off of everything kind of like if you can perform great there, then like perhaps\n\n[27:15] someday like there'll be a safe stuff that comes on market. That's, that's worth, worth trying. But\n\n[27:20] yeah, I also like, I like Marcus Surrealist like Stoicism is like the idea of kind of like,\n\n[27:23] you know, none of the necessary things, but like maybe there's some application of that philosophy\n\n[27:26] that I think about it. Yeah, some part of that just makes me angry. Like I just really want to.\n\n[27:31] Well, it's like at all, you know, kind of like the caloric, I'm, I don't know, I'm a dichotomy.\n\n[27:37] Like it's, it's all stretched apart because I'm very much a creature of habit. Okay. That being\n\n[27:43] said, I like caloric restriction, not having like a beer with my friends, like all of this stuff.\n\n[27:49] I just like, don't, I'm not doing it. I'd rather, I'd rather work out an extra time, but then,\n\n[27:56] but then some people say like, that's bad for your heart. Right. You know, like you can't win.\n\n[28:01] Yeah. So I don't know. I feel like in some ways it's like the devil I know. And I just avoid\n\n[28:08] other vices like texting while driving and smoking. That's interesting.\n\n[28:18] Hmm. What is like the thing that you do that you're the most proud of, like the habit that\n\n[28:21] is like the hardest for you to maintain that you never the less are kind of like quite happy to\n\n[28:25] like be able to do?\n\n[28:29] I mean, exercise is no problem because I go crazy. I go crazy without doing it. Right.\n\n[28:37] I think what's consistently the hardest to maintain is giving energy to the side projects that\n\n[28:45] are creatively demanding. Oh, that's interesting. Because I, this is what I didn't expect. I used\n\n[28:52] to work for myself and now I work at YC and obviously, and there are obviously like you\n\n[29:00] have so much energy in a day and obviously you can like push harder and get work done and like be\n\n[29:05] more disciplined. But I found that like there are certain side project ideas that are just kind of\n\n[29:14] like too much to even think about. Oh, interesting. And so I'm, yeah, like when I, when I make progress\n\n[29:20] on that, I'm very happy with myself because the side projects that are like, you know,\n\n[29:24] I've like made like little SaaS tools and stuff and that's cool, but it's definitely not the\n\n[29:30] hardest thing. And what like allows you to make progress on those projects?\n\n[29:36] Just internal motivation, like wanting to do it. I think the, what's always helpful is just imagine\n\n[29:43] yourself in 10 years and like look back. Oh, interesting. And then just use that as a metric\n\n[29:49] for like what you want to, would you be proud of yourself for having done that?\n\n[29:53] That seems like something like the, the business framework of like, you know, when you're 60 and\n\n[29:56] you kind of look back on your life. Yeah. That's interesting. But then, but it's dude, it's like,\n\n[30:02] who's to say what's going to lead to the next thing? That's great. So like, you know, all right. So\n\n[30:08] before we did the podcast, like I was talking about working at the onion, right? Right. And now I'm\n\n[30:12] here. Yeah. And you're like, that's not a standard trajectory. Right. So you can't really say\n\n[30:20] authoritatively, like the best way to spend your time is X. But when I, when I was a kid,\n\n[30:29] someone said to me, like, before you start working on something, think about what winning looks like.\n\n[30:34] And that's kind of a framework for projects for me. Oh, that's interesting. But I don't know.\n\n[30:41] That's a personal thing. What other like hacks and motivations like do you have in your arsenal?\n\n[30:52] I just don't spend time with people that annoy me or like stress me out.\n\n[30:56] Okay. Yeah, that's a positive thing. I am never busy, but I am fine using that excuse.\n\n[31:06] Oh, you're never busy. I always have time for my friends and like the things I really want to do.\n\n[31:12] And I just cut everything else out. So I don't know. How about you?\n\n[31:17] That makes hacks and motivations. I think it's like always trying to keep the baseline pretty,\n\n[31:24] pretty low, like kind of, you know, like, yeah, like I think like you can, you can control like\n\n[31:29] your output, but you can't really control like how the world responds. So it's kind of like,\n\n[31:32] if you're just like, all right, if I do good output, then like, that's great. And then like,\n\n[31:35] how are the world responds? Like can't control it. But like, like being really happy when you\n\n[31:39] do stuff that you can control is, I think, probably the biggest like mental hack for\n\n[31:43] because I mean, you just can't control. It's so hard because you're, you're still pretty young.\n\n[31:48] How old are you? 24. Yeah. So I remember when I just moved out here, I am. How old were you then?\n\n[31:56] 23, 23. Oh, interesting. You just come out of college or? Yeah. So what happened was,\n\n[32:03] I was in New York for college and then I lived there for like a couple years afterwards.\n\n[32:08] And my girlfriend and I split up and I was like, I'd always wanted to live in California and New\n\n[32:13] York was just like grinding at me. And so I just moved out here. Oh, interesting. Wow.\n\n[32:20] Which has been cool. And so when I. Did you have a job or something or just like moved out?\n\n[32:25] So the onion moved from New York to Chicago and almost everyone left. And so I started a company\n\n[32:31] with my friends and we were doing these hackathons where developers and comedians made stuff together.\n\n[32:37] And it's like it was a total not startup, total small business. Super fun. Yeah. And we did one\n\n[32:45] with Twitter. And so I moved out here for that thinking I would be out here for like months.\n\n[32:50] And now it's like whatever, six years later. But what about California was like so different\n\n[32:54] for you that you had to stay here? Well, I love doing outdoor stuff for sure. Okay.\n\n[33:00] But it's a trade. I don't know. Everyone wants to talk shit both ways. And it's totally a trade.\n\n[33:06] Culturally, it's not the same thing as New York. But then if you're working in like\n\n[33:09] tech, this is where or entertainment stuff. I mean, New York's kind of mix, but there's L.A.\n\n[33:16] It just seems so much so much more professional, not in like the Polish sense. Yeah. Like everyone\n\n[33:22] is like most people are here. And that's cool. That was cool to me. Like going to these like,\n\n[33:28] you know, coffee shops and seeing, you know, this person that I only seen on the Internet before.\n\n[33:33] And I was like, man, all this shit's happening here. That's interesting. But I don't know.\n\n[33:39] How do you think these have changed? And also, sorry, I don't want to like to,\n\n[33:41] but how do you think they've changed in the past seven years? Or I guess,\n\n[33:44] has it been seven years for you or something like that? Yeah. What has been the biggest thing\n\n[33:48] that's changed? Like I either both positive or negatively or neutrally in myself or in the\n\n[33:55] in like the environment that you've seen from like, oh, yeah, that's super easy. Tech is\n\n[34:00] completely vilified. That's been the biggest. Oh, interesting. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's like if\n\n[34:05] it's not this next election, it's the one afterwards. Like tech is the evil thing. Interesting.\n\n[34:11] And what did you see? What drove that or kind of. Well, in some ways, it's like an incredible amount\n\n[34:20] of wealth being accrued to a small amount of people. They're young. And I think their\n\n[34:27] amount of power is just off putting to so many folks, obviously with the Facebook thing and like\n\n[34:34] Gerard, like you have like the person to vilify and it just feels like the new banker to me.\n\n[34:40] And that's the that's been the shift. Not a great precedence.\n\n[34:45] And I don't know, because have you noticed anything?\n\n[34:50] Honestly, I think it's kind of like in bio is just, you know, no one pays attention to bio.\n\n[34:53] Like we're just all the way over here kind of like, you know, working on things that take\n\n[34:57] a really long time and are very like hard and expensive. And some people are like, oh, you know,\n\n[34:59] they're still over there, like still working on drugs. And I don't think as much. And they're\n\n[35:03] like very few. Weirdly, there are very few billionaires in biotech. I think this is something\n\n[35:07] that was very striking to me when I first came out of sort of like I was looking for people who were\n\n[35:10] amazing and also made like a lot of capital and biotech, like those are the people who like would\n\n[35:14] be successful and like know how to build business as well. This was my thought.\n\n[35:18] And there are very few of them. A lot of them were in VC who had invested in these companies.\n\n[35:22] I was like, where are the founders not getting the capital that like, how does that equation work?\n\n[35:27] And then I think one of them was like a former salesman. It's like the most\n\n[35:31] informative meeting I ever had about sales. He was just like, because I was trying to understand,\n\n[35:34] like, how do you sell a business or an idea? And like, you know, from MIT, it's like, you know,\n\n[35:38] complicated, like read a textbook about it and like write. And he was like, you just sit the\n\n[35:41] person down and tell them what to do. I was like, okay, now I think I understand how this like whole\n\n[35:48] area of like life, you know, what, how to communicate a little bit better than I did previously.\n\n[35:53] That's so funny. Yeah, I really hope more of these companies, I mean, they are popping up\n\n[35:58] already. Like you've seen longevity biotech. And if there is any kind of lull in the ecosystem,\n\n[36:04] it's just going to be like fertile ground. I think there's been historically a lack of like\n\n[36:09] founder different companies. And like, obviously, the funding environment has changed to make it\n\n[36:13] more likely to happen like the next couple of years. But it's just so strikingly, it really is\n\n[36:17] different when you have like, because I think if you look at like the wealth created in tech and\n\n[36:20] in biotech, it's like, you really see the distribution, you know, going so much more to venture capital,\n\n[36:24] I think, than to founders. And that was just, that's been like really, that was a really weird\n\n[36:28] thing to kind of like observe on like first coming here. So like, why is that the case?\n\n[36:32] Do you have different terms than normal VC funds?\n\n[36:34] Well, I mean, for our funds?\n\n[36:37] Yeah, I mean, if that's a like a strong opinion you have, like, what are your terms?\n\n[36:41] Yeah, well, by definition, like, you know, we have H1, so you know, so much what you folks are\n\n[36:44] working on, like, you know, that's founder driven, that's, you know, sort of trying to get people,\n\n[36:49] you know, sort of leg up and promote kind of like grad students, postdocs as the founders of the\n\n[36:53] company and like not try to replace them. Yeah, I guess like, like kind of some other firms,\n\n[36:56] which I think is a fair strategy if like that's, you know, sort of, you know, something that's been\n\n[37:01] your bulwark for like decades. But I mean, I think marketers would say it's similar to what's\n\n[37:06] happened in software, like, you know, you had this first wave of kind of like professional managers,\n\n[37:10] you kind of like a swing back to technologists, you kind of like a swing back to the middle of\n\n[37:12] kind of like, now we'd like some more managers, please, but like, you know, still technologists\n\n[37:15] are kind of driving the show. I think in bio, we might be kind of like midway through that,\n\n[37:18] we're kind of like, we've had like the managers period for a long time, we might have more\n\n[37:22] technologists. And then like, maybe kind of like swing back to the middle. That's like a pretty\n\n[37:26] simple pattern match. Like, you know, who knows what will happen in the future?\n\n[37:28] Hmm. Yeah, because the that's interesting if it's a trailing thing from software,\n\n[37:34] because you probably know. Yeah. So what's happened now is like maybe 10 years ago,\n\n[37:38] or when YC started, it was incredibly rare for you to be able to just like pitch an idea.\n\n[37:43] Exactly. Now you can easily do that. But more importantly, you can I mean, I hear crazy numbers\n\n[37:50] from people leaving college and going to work at Facebook or big companies. And I think that's like\n\n[37:54] overall probably bad for the ecosystem, because like it encourages this like extreme risk aversion.\n\n[38:00] Right. And I think the likelihood of lifestyle inflation and never starting something is high.\n\n[38:06] But think about so what enabled YC, right? AWS, from the outside, a huge part of it, right? Like\n\n[38:15] the first ever ability driven by tooling to kind of spin something up really cheaply.\n\n[38:20] And I think in bio, and it's like what everyone talks about, sort of like, you know, there really\n\n[38:23] was this point where like, you know, dropping cost of sequencing has been occurring over the past,\n\n[38:27] like, you know, 18 years. But really up until like the past two or four years, you could not\n\n[38:31] get a thousand dollar genome, right? Like that is a recent phenomenon. And so what argument would be\n\n[38:35] like, you know, look at like Illumina's revenues, you know, like today, it's absolutely crazy how\n\n[38:40] some of the art like Intel's revenues, like right in the 1970s, or like the parallel there is like\n\n[38:44] extremely. And this is like, you know, our friend of mine may to like notice this, but kind of like\n\n[38:48] there's just like this really striking parallel between like the enabler technology that we kind\n\n[38:52] of see, you know, in kind of like one segment and then kind of like what's happening about today.\n\n[38:56] And who knows what will happen in the future, but there is an interesting parallel there.\n\n[38:59] Hmm. Huh. Would you think there are people in labs? Well, actually, like what percentage\n\n[39:05] of people working in labs do you think want to start companies? So this is the fascinating thing.\n\n[39:09] So we were we were curious about this because if you look at the amount of funding that's available\n\n[39:13] on the venture side to go into biotech in the past couple of years, it's insanely, I mean,\n\n[39:17] it's double tripled in the past couple of years alone, but the number of companies funded has\n\n[39:22] stayed fairly constant. And so we're just looking at this like, what the heck is happening here?\n\n[39:26] Right. And what's happened is like the number on the top end of like the median hasn't even\n\n[39:30] changed. It's like the top end of court, like the top court of companies are getting more capital\n\n[39:33] per company. So it's like all capital has come from LPs because you've seen like, you know,\n\n[39:38] the nasdaq biotech index, you know, go from like stagnant, you know, up until 2011 to like\n\n[39:42] monotonically increasing or with a small dip. And then it's like, where do you put all this capital?\n\n[39:48] There are no more companies to invest in. And so we were like, well, why are more people\n\n[39:51] not starting companies? We went and talked to like a hundred grad students and postdocs\n\n[39:55] and the answer they gave us was like absolutely striking. It was like most of them. So it may be\n\n[39:59] like, you know, 10% were worried about reputation risk. Like they didn't want to leave, fail and\n\n[40:02] then go back. 80% had never thought about the idea of starting a company. They just were not aware\n\n[40:07] that it was a possibility. And so you could argue, okay, maybe that's like they're not\n\n[40:11] entrepreneurial. But, you know, if you think about like, you know, in the eighties or the nineties,\n\n[40:14] like would you have gone as a CS student at Stanford, like started something? Maybe.\n\n[40:18] But like maybe you'd have a lot higher of a barrier or bar to doing that. I think that's\n\n[40:21] part of why she started something, that process easier. And so I think really what it's like,\n\n[40:25] it's just a lack of education and kind of like just availability of options to these people,\n\n[40:30] which is like, makes you so angry, right? Like, you know, like you should never be forced or kind\n\n[40:34] of like convince you something that you don't want to, or that's not good for you.\n\n[40:36] But you should be aware of your options. Like how are all these smart people\n\n[40:40] not aware of like all the possibilities that are out there for them?\n\n[40:43] I mean, I think the saddest slash funniest one I've heard is when someone often in like a hard\n\n[40:50] science, like lab or background, they learn about YC and then think that we're just giving them\n\n[40:55] loans. And they're like, oh, no, I can never do that. Yeah. Which is like, I mean, I don't know,\n\n[41:02] if you had no exposure to this, like, why wouldn't you think that? I mean, like,\n\n[41:07] and all of these myths exist, but I think the education thing is a good point. For the most\n\n[41:11] part, people don't even know. That's absolutely crazy. Yeah. So you should talk about your,\n\n[41:16] I mean, do you have, dude, you have so many questions, but you should also maybe mention\n\n[41:20] your project, Daniel, if, because that's relevant. Yes. Yes. Yeah. So I'm super excited. So my friend,\n\n[41:26] Daniel Gross started this really, really awesome sort of project called Pioneer.\n\n[41:32] And what Pioneer is, is it's trying to find like the lost Einstein's of the world,\n\n[41:36] which I think is like an awesome tagline. And I think Danny has a fascinating background in that.\n\n[41:41] He was kind of on track to join the Israeli army and then uploaded applications to YC.\n\n[41:47] And basically his whole life changed after like one flight out here and a meeting with\n\n[41:53] Paul Graham and sort of like this, you know, he's not this incredibly successful person,\n\n[41:57] but kind of like, you know, would he have had the same chance if not for like a lucky,\n\n[42:00] you know, I think his dad forwarded him like an article about YC, like that was how he found out\n\n[42:03] about it. Right. Really? I don't know. I think that's one thing you mentioned. So it's like,\n\n[42:07] this coincidence that kind of drove his journey. And so the question is like, you know, how many\n\n[42:10] people are there out there that like with a small intervention could like, you know, drastically\n\n[42:14] have like a different life course. And so Pioneer, sort of Pioneer.app is this place where if you're\n\n[42:20] anybody in the world and you have a project you want to work on, you can apply. It can be anything\n\n[42:24] anywhere from kind of like, I want to have more of my high school friends do like science stuff all\n\n[42:28] the way through to like, I'm 80 and I finally want to write my novel. And, you know, there's\n\n[42:33] a thing called the Pioneer Tournament where people work for about 30 days, kind of, you know, do\n\n[42:36] their projects and kind of like the community votes like on their kind of like most kind of,\n\n[42:40] you know, favorite people. And they kind of based on that at the end, you know, a set of people\n\n[42:44] are selected to like be flown to San Francisco, you receive about like a $5,000 grant and they\n\n[42:48] kind of like join the Pioneer community, which is kind of like this, you know, set of really\n\n[42:51] ambitious outsiders trying to change the world. And so I resonate this because like, you know,\n\n[42:56] my personal story was coming from New Zealand at age 12, you know, based on like a random email\n\n[43:01] I sent to like a professor here and it was the first time I ever sent to like someone who was\n\n[43:05] on a family member and she responded. But if she hadn't responded and like that luck hadn't occurred\n\n[43:09] and like, you know, where would I be? I have no idea. And so that's why I think it's just like\n\n[43:13] Pioneer is so exciting because it might help a lot and everyone who's listening, like you should\n\n[43:17] definitely, definitely apply. Pioneer.app. I think it unlocks so much potential of like everyone in\n\n[43:22] the world who like could be doing awesome things. I think it's so cool. Yeah, just enabling people\n\n[43:26] to like have the confidence thing has been the biggest surprise for me at YC. Oh, interesting.\n\n[43:32] I think a huge unspoken part of why YC is successful is that it gives people the confidence\n\n[43:39] to do their thing. Right. And they're often like, I mean, sometimes it's insider, you know, like\n\n[43:43] tracked, like I went to Stanford, whatever. But sometimes it's like total outsider people\n\n[43:48] and it works out. And I think that like, yeah, man, without systems that give people that\n\n[43:54] little extra push, a lot of people will never do it. Ah, interesting. It is counterintuitive. Yeah.\n\n[44:01] I mean, it's crazy, like, because I do these office hours occasionally with people who are\n\n[44:05] interested in applying, right? And they're awesome. They're great. And all it takes is like that one\n\n[44:11] meeting where you're just like, you're good enough. You can do it. And that's it. That's so\n\n[44:15] fascinating. And then they apply. Huh. It's crazy. Interesting. Yeah.\n\n[44:23] I mean, I think one of the fascinating things that Danny's going to run into is sort of like, how do you\n\n[44:28] give that to like, how do you scale that feeling of like transmitting confidence?\n\n[44:35] It was like, you know, yeah, it's non-trivial. Well, you asked me about podcasts before we started,\n\n[44:40] right? And so this is like a crazy side effect of podcasting because it makes you feel and the\n\n[44:50] thing it makes you feel like you know someone really well. But the reality is you kind of do.\n\n[44:56] And so that like that relationship of someone as like, whatever, just like friend or mentor or\n\n[45:04] whatever, is enough to be like, oh, like, I kind of get this. I can be myself with them and I can\n\n[45:12] kind of just like express whatever I want to do. But then there are totally like weird elements for\n\n[45:16] me. Like I'll be like in the bathroom at demo day, literally, I'll be in the bathroom at demo day.\n\n[45:21] And like someone will like tap me on the back and be like, oh man, I like the podcast. Like, cool.\n\n[45:24] Not now. That's so funny. Do people feel like they know you from hearing so many of your\n\n[45:30] conversations with others and kind of like how you think about the world? I guess like, because\n\n[45:33] you said that one thing that you find fascinating is like how other people think about the world.\n\n[45:36] Yeah. I guess like the way that you ask questions must give so much information about how you\n\n[45:40] build models or view systems or how stupid I am. Yeah, no, I mean, I don't talk a ton\n\n[45:51] about myself. I mean, I do. But yeah, people get the sense. And I was actually thinking about\n\n[45:56] talking to my friend about this this morning of like, what is it about the how am I different on\n\n[46:02] the podcast versus in real life? Because there's like some distance for both of us, right? There's\n\n[46:07] like going to be some dissonance there. Right. And I'm curious about like how to best merge the two.\n\n[46:14] And I haven't figured it out yet because I actually don't know what the gap is.\n\n[46:18] So you don't know what your podcast is? I was about to text him and I didn't.\n\n[46:22] And yeah. Because I mean, you seem pretty kind of like on the surface similar. But yeah, I guess\n\n[46:30] it would be hard to know without one period of observation. Have you listened to it before?\n\n[46:34] No, just the conflict like our 50 minute conversation before we started and kind of like.\n\n[46:38] Oh, right. But I guess basically it's the same thing. Yeah, maybe. Huh. Interesting. Yeah, I\n\n[46:42] don't know. It'd be better if you were more like the person that you like. Yeah, like what what\n\n[46:49] authenticity do you think would would bring like that? Like you don't have kind of now curious.\n\n[46:58] So in some ways, I'm just selfishly interested in like making it something that feels more like\n\n[47:06] me. And it's it's my thing. Right. You're always curious about like\n\n[47:13] gains, you know, what can make the show better. Right. And when I think about the podcast that I\n\n[47:20] like, you know, things like Rogan, stuff like that. I mean, I mean, like that's not fringe,\n\n[47:26] but I imagine and this is again like projecting because I've never hung out with him.\n\n[47:32] I imagine that it's like very close to what hanging out with the person is like.\n\n[47:38] And then when I watch the podcast and me sometimes I can tell that I'm nervous\n\n[47:43] or not as like, I don't know, natural as normal. Do you think it's the environment? Like if you\n\n[47:49] if you made this like feel like you're living in that it would be slightly different or?\n\n[47:54] Um, yeah, it's possible. Yeah, it's totally. I mean, I think one thing that would be beneficial\n\n[48:01] is like hang. I mean, you're this is, you know, you're great. So it's like very chilled. It's\n\n[48:04] very easy. Yeah. But sometimes like hanging out with someone beforehand. Oh, I see. So\n\n[48:10] it feels like you have a conversation and then it just continues into. Yeah. And the\n\n[48:16] the my desire to keep it like on topic can make it less natural than it could be.\n\n[48:24] Right. That makes sense. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. Because you always come back to like\n\n[48:30] one thing, but then maybe like that's not actually the organic way that it would have gone.\n\n[48:35] Right. Because I mean, like, well, actually, this would be a good test because I'll put this one\n\n[48:38] out and people like, dude, what the fuck are you doing? Stay on topic with longevity stuff. Yeah.\n\n[48:43] Yeah. I don't know. Yeah.\n\n[48:46] Totally interesting. I don't know. It's tough because you are you a podcast person?\n\n[48:50] I actually am not. Like, I really only do books and papers\n\n[48:58] because podcasts are kind of annoying. Like, you can't fast forward to them easily and kind\n\n[49:01] of like use your eyes like figure out if like they were transcribed, then I might read them.\n\n[49:05] But yeah, which you can. Some do. We do. But not everyone. But then I also feel like I don't. I\n\n[49:11] think there's like something about being decorated, you know, because if everyone's\n\n[49:15] listening to the same podcasts and you go and like spend the same amount of time reading like\n\n[49:19] people like the Greeks kind of, you know, like what the cities was thinking, you might have like\n\n[49:24] very outdated information that's like not very informed, you know, about today. But you also\n\n[49:28] might like, I guess, get a similar feel for how somebody was, but have it be like more\n\n[49:32] decorrelated and therefore ideally kind of like more sort of like maybe give you like a better\n\n[49:38] viewpoint than the normal. I think you should. I think it's like, I mean, dude, the amount of\n\n[49:43] times I've heard people reference Sapiens or Charlie Munger is like, I just can't deal. I mean,\n\n[49:48] they're great. They're awesome ideas, whatever. Right. But like everyone's consuming the same\n\n[49:53] media. Yeah. And I think it's interesting because like if you if you don't and you try to understand\n\n[49:58] it from first principles, which I think is like for first principles itself, I think like kind of\n\n[50:02] like I think that is often cited as like the good thing, but maybe not fully understood.\n\n[50:06] It can be quite different. I think one thing most people don't realize like, you know, math and\n\n[50:10] science often are like more artistic than they are kind of like logical. But like everyone's trying\n\n[50:13] to like frame things like a logical process. So yeah, well, because it's I think a counter\n\n[50:17] intuitive thing is that you well, I mean, it's obvious when you say it out loud to pursue an idea\n\n[50:25] in math or science, you have to be inspired to pursue it because you don't know if it's true\n\n[50:29] beforehand. Exactly. No, it's so crazy. Like, I think it's fascinating. You look at Noon,\n\n[50:36] right? Like Noon spent he had like this amazing year when he was 21. He like discovers all these\n\n[50:40] things. And then he goes into like alchemy in the Bible. And you're like, what? Like, where does\n\n[50:44] that come from? But I think part of it is like, the kind I mean, obviously, it's illogical and\n\n[50:49] analytical, like is he's like, books, we're so curious. But I think also like he has some kind\n\n[50:54] of like, a little bit like a mysticism, like this kind of this weird aspect of it's like a little\n\n[50:57] bit artistic. And we kind of like we forget that we're like, oh, yeah, like scientists are kind of\n\n[51:01] like robots. But they're they're really Yeah, they're they're really not. Definitely not.\n\n[51:07] Definitely not. All right. So let's actually get some of these questions.\n\n[51:12] All right, man. So which ones appeal to you? Because we have so many.\n\n[51:17] I think the ones that are like factual are good. So just like the the research questions,\n\n[51:21] probably do that. So maybe we should rip through because I'm genuinely interested in a lot of\n\n[51:29] these. And I read I read your longevity FAQ, which is awesome. It's very like Tim Urban,\n\n[51:36] wait, but why style? Maybe it's the drawings that got me. Yeah. But that was cool. Yeah. Yeah. That\n\n[51:44] must have taken a lot of work. It's like, you know, just drawing the kind of like axes and then like\n\n[51:49] three lines is. Yeah, it was hard. So Sanbatesh asks, do you think there's going to be another\n\n[51:58] step function change in human lifespan since, you know, germ theory? What's the next one? I think\n\n[52:04] this is a super fascinating question and time to be alive because like, you know, you know, it really\n\n[52:10] it's fascinating. You look back and kind of like, you know, germ theory is just like such a huge\n\n[52:14] breakthrough. I think the one thing I think is lost also is like there's another breakthrough\n\n[52:18] that's similar related, which is that like life comes from life. Yeah. Because like for all history,\n\n[52:23] we think that like there's spontaneous generation of life, like literally up until like, you know,\n\n[52:27] right about that time. And then the steers like, nope, nope, nope. Like, you know, these germs\n\n[52:31] are coming in like through like the neck of the pipe. It's not. And so, you know, that and that\n\n[52:35] was a huge breakthrough. And then, you know, obviously Darwin kind of like, you know, also\n\n[52:39] very important. I think the thing that we kind of have an intuition will be important in longevity\n\n[52:44] that most people are kind of not paying attention to is like what it's going to sound way too\n\n[52:49] philosophical, but really when you get into it, I think it's the important thing. What does it mean\n\n[52:52] to be alive? And at what point are you kind of differentiating between like the germ line,\n\n[52:59] which is kind of like your reproductive cells and the so much kind of like your kind of, you know,\n\n[53:03] skin and tissue, because there is a immortal line of kind of like living kind of things that has\n\n[53:08] been replicating since like our first ancestor, right? Transmitted through our germ line. When I\n\n[53:13] have a kid, that kid does not come out and like have the same amount of aging that I do when I\n\n[53:17] have it. It is kind of like brand new, right? And like, how the heck does that happen? And how do\n\n[53:22] you fit that kind of paradigm? And if you take, for example, a bacterium, now there's some\n\n[53:25] bacteria that do asymmetrically divide and like possibly have some form of aging, but kind of like\n\n[53:29] you, you know, do you look at a bacterium and think like that, that thing is aging? Maybe, maybe not.\n\n[53:34] And so what is it about multilayered and kind of like our germ line and the differentiation between\n\n[53:38] the two that's caused us to kind of evolve or start this kind of like aging phenomenon?\n\n[53:43] And, you know, given that, is it natural? Can we think about how our desire to kind of like\n\n[53:47] live longer ourselves fits into kind of like that differentiation? Because, you know, nature has\n\n[53:51] already solved for kind of like living forever on some level, right? On the cell level. And so kind\n\n[53:55] of what is it about, yeah, our soma that like is so different and are there any things that we can\n\n[54:00] repurpose and use, you know, for that? And so I think that that area is going to be super,\n\n[54:05] super fascinating. And then I'm also just broadly in love with the question, like, what is life,\n\n[54:08] right? Kind of like that's so interesting. Like, you know, Schrödinger in like the 1930s,\n\n[54:11] kind of like writing these fascinating tracks, like bringing like Maxwell book and others in.\n\n[54:14] And so that, you know, that and kind of the people thinking about it, like, you know, sort of\n\n[54:18] Jermaine Lind at MIT are just absolutely incredible in their work. That that's probably\n\n[54:23] sort of a longer answer, like, you know, we just think like, I love these questions,\n\n[54:27] sort of like, you know, we spend so much time thinking about like the practicalities,\n\n[54:29] but kind of like the higher level order of like, what would be the actual breakthrough? I think\n\n[54:32] that like that that are just like really interesting.\n\n[54:36] Sort of tangent. You mentioned, yeah, giving birth is someone working. I mean, I assume someone,\n\n[54:43] but like, are people working on extending fertility windows if you extend health spend?\n\n[54:48] Because that seems like, you know, if you could live forever, right. As a dude, like I can just\n\n[54:53] opt out. Right. Like, all right, I'm not going to have kids or I'm not going to like in my mind,\n\n[54:59] that's the real issue. Right. It's like allocating time. Yeah. You know, so if,\n\n[55:03] say you work aggressively until you're 30 or 35 or whatever, and then you have kids,\n\n[55:09] like all of a sudden you have to take care of this thing or it will die. Right. So being able\n\n[55:13] to push that till you're 60 seems like really valuable. Yeah. Well, so we think that's that's\n\n[55:20] that is sort of I don't want to say fascinating too many times, but it's a fascinating area\n\n[55:25] because there are some animals, many in fact, where like, you know, you have some octopi that\n\n[55:30] lay their eggs and then their mouth disappears and they're like sitting on their eggs and like\n\n[55:34] literally commit suicide. And if you reverse like glandular action, like gives rise to that,\n\n[55:38] they just keep on living. And so it's like you have programs in essence all over the animal kingdom\n\n[55:42] and like we're, you know, anthropocentric humans and so we say, oh, that doesn't happen to us. But\n\n[55:46] if you think about menopause, right, like in women, like what is that? That is a clocked acute onset\n\n[55:52] of kind of loss of health, right? Not as fertility, like many other things you get,\n\n[55:55] your distribution, you like bone loss acutely at the time of menopause. So many other things get\n\n[56:00] like a lot worse in a clocked fashion. You kind of look at other animals like, oh, we're all like\n\n[56:04] that. But really, are we that different? And so that area is just there are even some hormones\n\n[56:09] that we're looking into right now that are involved in that process that we think are super fasting\n\n[56:12] for longevity. And so I think like that area is just, yeah, it's really, really interesting.\n\n[56:16] So yeah, I mean, is it more, I imagine it's more likely for it to be an artificial womb\n\n[56:21] than re-engineering humans, but maybe that's inaccurate.\n\n[56:23] I think the artificial womb is not one that we necessarily look at because it's sort of like not,\n\n[56:27] you know, if you solve that problem when it's just like solve longevity problem.\n\n[56:31] But I think there's actually, you know, that would be cool, but like even just thinking about like,\n\n[56:35] what is menopause? Right? Because like, you know, why is it so timed? Like what is the clock that\n\n[56:41] like turns on? And if we like turned off that clock, like would it push backward? Is there some\n\n[56:45] kind of natural? And there's some like obvious answers for that. But I, you know, it just,\n\n[56:50] it really is. And you think about how did evolution decide like that was the correct time?\n\n[56:54] So that I think that it was just like, yeah, really, really interesting.\n\n[56:56] That's awesome. All right. Jason Choi asks, what's the percentage of longevity attributable\n\n[57:02] to lifestyle choices versus genetics and the progress of technology and influencing both?\n\n[57:07] Oh, interesting. So there's a recent paper that actually came out, a super fascinating\n\n[57:12] with guy, Yaniv Ehrlich in science. And what it did was they have a public database of heredity.\n\n[57:16] So basically like a family tree, unfortunately doesn't have actual genomic data for each person,\n\n[57:21] but you have a lot of lifespan data. So age, birth and sort of death dates, many generations back.\n\n[57:27] And so you can ask, what is the kind of like hereditability of longevity? You know,\n\n[57:32] if your parents lived longer, are you also likely to live longer? And I think prior to that,\n\n[57:36] we'd had about a 25% hereditability kind of figure. I think that dropped to like about 11%.\n\n[57:40] I could be off on this figure, but I think that paper was about 11%. Could be wrong. And so that,\n\n[57:45] I think that's kind of the current statement from the field is that like that's, you know,\n\n[57:50] our prior like percentage of longevity attributable to genetics. I think that\n\n[57:54] underestimates the potential impact of genetics on longevity because sort of like, you know,\n\n[57:57] do you have kind of like, you know, mutants that are like long lived in the population? No.\n\n[58:02] And so maybe, you know, I think it doesn't tell you like how much genes could be changed influence\n\n[58:06] longevity. But yeah, about 11% would be like the current estimate from the field.\n\n[58:10] Okay. Thank you. Fatih asks, is blood transfusion, so this is parabiosis.\n\n[58:17] Is it a thing or just a hoax? Oh gosh, no, the blood boy question. Oh,\n\n[58:21] wait, the blood boys are like, they fall surround everywhere we go, we were asked about the blood\n\n[58:26] boys. So one thing that's fascinating, right, is like, sorry, it's fascinating all the time.\n\n[58:30] If you go back and ask, what are the first ever things discovered to impact longevity?\n\n[58:37] You know, the tools that we had prior to 1950 did not allow us to do genetics, they did not allow\n\n[58:43] on the molecular level, they did not allow us to do like any of the things that we now kind of\n\n[58:47] focus on longevity. The one thing that Alex Carell in 1912 gets the Nobel Prize for sewing blood\n\n[58:52] vessels together. And so what is one of the things that is tried in the early half of like the 20th\n\n[58:56] century, because like that's the only thing that we have the tools to do. It's like literally,\n\n[59:00] you know, like you're sewing blood vessels together between a young and old mouse. And that does\n\n[59:03] appear to have positive impacts. There are three or four nature and science papers that\n\n[59:07] have come out recently showing, you know, there's some positive impact on kind of like the function\n\n[59:11] of the brain, some positive impact on function of the heart, some on muscle. So we do see positive\n\n[59:16] impacts. I haven't seen to date a really good longevity study. So I think we've seen a lot\n\n[59:22] of evidence of like age related kind of phenotypes getting better. But I personally have not seen a\n\n[59:26] study that like really, you know, makes me super excited about kind of like the number of extra\n\n[59:30] years. Lots of stuff to like indicate that might be the case if done correctly, but just I actually\n\n[59:34] haven't seen that study, you know, like sort of done yet. There's been some studies published like\n\n[59:39] in the mid 1900s about parabiosis that I think I might have cited that kind of indicated an\n\n[59:44] exception, but they're kind of like really replicated properly to really believe that.\n\n[59:48] And so I think, you know, there's probably some impact on lifespan. Like I don't think we have\n\n[59:50] that well characterized yet. Okay. So true, like not a hoax, not a hoax, but I think people really\n\n[59:59] over-focused on that because it's such an easy story to tell. Right. Like vampires, vampires,\n\n[60:02] I get that. And you're like, no, no, no, no, no, like, you know, 60 different things that make,\n\n[60:07] you know, acts live longer and like you have to look at, you know, but people don't want to hear\n\n[60:10] about like daft humans and receptor. They want to hear about like vampires. Yeah. No, I mean,\n\n[60:13] it's just like, like kind of what I was saying before about like tech being seen as black and\n\n[60:17] white, like sort of like everything people just want the pill. Oh, actually I wanted to talk about\n\n[60:21] rapamycin. Yeah. So my friend, Nicola wrote a New York article about it. Oh, awesome. I'm like, I'm\n\n[60:31] slightly terrified. But can you, can you just break it down? So, so rapamycin is this, is this\n\n[60:38] really, really interesting drug discovered on Rapa Nui, the aisle in a soil sample, as many,\n\n[60:42] many drugs were. And, you know, kind of what it does is many things, but, but I think one thing\n\n[60:48] that's been focused on is an impact on what's called mTOR, which is a protein that's part of\n\n[60:52] kind of two different complexes of proteins. And so, you know, the problem with rapamycin is it has\n\n[60:57] a lot of kind of like side effects, right? It's originally developed as like, you know, maybe\n\n[61:01] immune suppressant in one use. And so do you really want to be taking that like, you know,\n\n[61:04] continuously? Probably not. There's a lot of doctors, you know, if you ask kind of like a\n\n[61:09] subset of kind of the people who specialize in crazy things that might actually work in longevity,\n\n[61:14] if you then will say like pulse rapamycin, so taking rapamycin and very kind of, you know,\n\n[61:18] cute doses, but then like on a schedule, not continuously is a good thing. And I think that\n\n[61:23] like we don't see that like being disproven or like implausible, just kind of like, it is,\n\n[61:27] I think a risky endeavor on some level. One thing I would say is, you know, there are several\n\n[61:31] companies trying to develop much safer versions that do the same thing. So like have the positive\n\n[61:35] benefit, like don't have like all the other kind of like sort of negative, negative effects.\n\n[61:39] And so I personally just kind of like wait until those like get a little bit farther along.\n\n[61:43] But I mean, rapamycin is kind of reported. I think the other fascinating thing is like,\n\n[61:47] I don't think we have a great feeling for what the max is on the life expectancy that's possible\n\n[61:51] with rapamycin. Like the question is like, if you dose it up, like what's the maximum dose and how\n\n[61:56] at what point you start to get like decreasing returns of longevity. It's not clear that we've\n\n[62:00] actually hit that barrier quite well. That's the other fascinating like sort of thing.\n\n[62:03] Interesting. What about, I've heard people taking testosterone and like that is debated over like,\n\n[62:09] maybe it increases health span, but it actually might shorten lifespan.\n\n[62:12] No, we get a lot of, you know, there's a lot of people who are like, we're in a low T society.\n\n[62:16] There's also, I think a lot of people taking growth hormone, you know, for longevity.\n\n[62:20] And when I first saw that in kind of like an airplane magazine, I was furious because like\n\n[62:24] in worms, if you like knock out the analog of growth hormone receptor, they live longer.\n\n[62:30] And mice like dwarf mice are the long lived mice and like within a species, not, you know,\n\n[62:34] between species, but within a species, you know, being smaller is actually a correlate with kind\n\n[62:38] of like longevity. But I think, you know, one thing there is like maybe taking growth hormone\n\n[62:42] makes an 80 year old feel a lot better. So it's kind of like a health span optimization. So back\n\n[62:47] to that kind of like, you know, do you feel better like that results in longer lifespan?\n\n[62:49] But I don't think that's a great thing, obviously do for kind of like actual lifespan.\n\n[62:54] Yeah. Because to clarify, it can increase or encourage like cancer cell growth?\n\n[63:01] I mean, there's this possible minor thing there, but I think for the most part,\n\n[63:04] there's a not fully defined complex signaling pathway that seems to kind of be quite related\n\n[63:10] to longevity that was first discovered in worms and then kind of like also characterized in humans.\n\n[63:15] Like there's a subset of dwarfs, for example, who appear to compare to their relatives suffer much\n\n[63:20] less cancer and metabolic disease. And that correlates with what you'd expect from mice.\n\n[63:25] Like if you mutate mice to be dwarfs, they live about 60% longer than normal, like 60%.\n\n[63:30] It's pretty nontrivial.\n\n[63:31] Pretty solid.\n\n[63:32] Right.\n\n[63:33] How much shorter would you be if you could live 60% longer?\n\n[63:35] How much shorter? I'm not quantitative. I don't know. I'm not like 10%, obviously,\n\n[63:41] but like, you know, between a 50 and 70. But I'm not actually sure for those mice how much more\n\n[63:48] they were quantitatively. But I think the interesting thing is you can actually possibly\n\n[63:51] de-correlate like the being smaller with the effect. So it's like not just like a size,\n\n[63:55] it's like a signaling thing as well.\n\n[63:56] Would you make that trade if you're like one foot tall?\n\n[64:00] The trade is positive. So the idea is like you can decouple like the being small with\n\n[64:04] like longevity benefits.\n\n[64:05] Oh, I know. But I'm asking you would you rather?\n\n[64:07] Oh, would I make that trade? Yeah, probably.\n\n[64:10] Probably. Yeah. Yeah. That's awesome.\n\n[64:12] So Aubrey de Grey, another like kind of famous longevity person, someone asked about them.\n\n[64:18] So Chris asks, he's mentioned several times about replacing organs with new organic ones\n\n[64:23] before they fail. Is that a reasonable idea or would they more likely be replaced with synthetic\n\n[64:29] ones?\n\n[64:29] Oh, interesting. I think so this is an area that we're still building our, it's like maybe\n\n[64:34] too late to be like seven years and still thesis building. But I think there are so\n\n[64:40] many things that have to go right for that to become like the obvious thing to do.\n\n[64:45] In some ways it's like the oldest version of aging, right? And that like back to our\n\n[64:49] friend Alex Carell and his Nobel Prize, he is doing the first ever kind of like sewing\n\n[64:53] of kind of like the organs and kind of like, let's get a little few readers papers like,\n\n[64:57] let's just grab this like dog kidney and like, we'll take this one from this other dog and\n\n[64:59] like, you know, plug it in. And he's just, and you're like, wow, that's the early 1900s.\n\n[65:03] So in a sense, what Aubrey's proposing is the oldest most kind of like worked on\n\n[65:08] idea. But then, you know, I think we also, we just haven't seen that done well on the\n\n[65:14] rejuvenation front a lot recently. And I think I don't, I think we're still following, you know,\n\n[65:19] there's some things where like, if you get an organ from somebody who's had cancer, for example,\n\n[65:22] there's like a small risk like 10 years later, you might also incur like some kind of negative\n\n[65:26] event. It's just things like that. I think we're still understanding kind of how to weigh those\n\n[65:31] risks. But I think it's fascinating. It's a surprising fact that it is, you know, sounds the\n\n[65:35] most futuristic, but it's actually the most kind of like old method of kind of like considering\n\n[65:39] working in the space. Right. Well, you're just like, take the part out, put it in another,\n\n[65:43] right, to go. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So I have a very important question. So Micah said you did a\n\n[65:49] cookie diet. Is that true? Yes. Yeah. How did that go? I think it was pretty informative in that,\n\n[65:58] you know, again, I wouldn't recommend any way to like go just cookies, but- Were these like fancy\n\n[66:02] health food cookies? No, no. So the reason I did it was my friend had claimed that he had only eaten\n\n[66:09] whipped cream and bacon for a month and that this was possible. Of course it's possible. Yeah.\n\n[66:15] Right. But then he was like, but I actually feel pretty good too. And I thought that it was total\n\n[66:18] BS and that he probably, I mean, he's a very smart and like, you know, conscientious person. So I was\n\n[66:23] like, well, like either he's like very different than I really thought he was or that's possible\n\n[66:27] to do. And so I wanted to test it. And so I tried that and I was like, well, you actually kind of can\n\n[66:33] and you kind of feel fine. And so then I was just like curious, like if you took any random thing,\n\n[66:37] like any random food object, like just ate that for a month, like what would happen? And the cookie\n\n[66:43] diet like worked very well, but I just, for the long term, it seemed like probably not a good idea.\n\n[66:47] So switching off of that to like a lower sugar diet is probably a good idea. Did you, were you\n\n[66:50] doing blood tests or was all by feel? No, no, I should have done blood tests. That's funny. Yeah.\n\n[66:55] There was this well-known long distance hiker named Andrew Skurka. He's written up a bunch of\n\n[67:00] blogs and stuff and he's pretty well known for having kind of extreme, like he just has a diet\n\n[67:06] that can take anything it seems like. So he was like, I think for a while it was just like snickers\n\n[67:12] and Pringles, something like that. That sounds great. Yeah. I mean, I guess if you have enough\n\n[67:17] toothpaste like on the Pacific Crest Trail, you're fine. Yeah. You have to kind of wonder though,\n\n[67:24] like how much worse that would be then. Like one of the examples, right? I think that like a lot of,\n\n[67:27] for example, eating meat, maybe the worst part of it is like if your animal is stressed, like had like\n\n[67:31] a lot of the incorrect type of hormone directly before like being killed, but actually like a more\n\n[67:35] important thing, like whether you're eating meat or not, just sort of like what the kind of like\n\n[67:38] minor things are that we don't think about, like the axes that aren't like explicit,\n\n[67:41] like what those are. But yeah, hard to say. Hard to say. Cool. All right. My last question is,\n\n[67:46] are you seriously not doing anything really weird? There's like no pills, there's no weird food,\n\n[67:52] there's no crazy fasting. I mean, I think that like apart from trying to do the cookie diet,\n\n[67:58] so one thing that I was trying to do for a while was like, I was trying to like\n\n[68:02] quantitatively understand, you know, because we're just like black boxes and like you intake some\n\n[68:06] number of calories and like you should be able to calculate like where they all go, kind of like\n\n[68:10] how many are necessary to like eat each day, kind of like from first principles, like figure out kind\n\n[68:14] of like what optimal diet would be. I tried to do that for muscle. So I was like, like how many\n\n[68:18] proteins should we eat 30 minutes after working out? The first problem was it's really hard,\n\n[68:22] like why 30 minutes after working out is the correct amount of time? No idea because sort\n\n[68:24] of like, you know, our cells are expanding at a period of time, but like it's hard to, you know,\n\n[68:28] figure out. Also just got really down in the weeds of like how many amino acids would be required to\n\n[68:33] like replace certain things. And I think I came out of that just kind of like very convinced,\n\n[68:37] like a lot of the things that like people talk about at a high level are like wrong and like\n\n[68:40] provably theoretically still like a lower level and that like I shouldn't have the time to kind\n\n[68:44] of like really think about doing that for like a full diet. And so I think at this point until I\n\n[68:49] have like, you know, maybe a full year to kind of like go back and understand that whole area\n\n[68:52] better, it's kind of like just, you know, the obvious things because history is probably like\n\n[68:57] a good teacher for like, you know, baseline health. Nice. All right. If someone wants to learn more\n\n[69:02] about you, where should they go? Yes. So we run longevity fund and I'm just laura at longevity.vc\n\n[69:08] and anyone can reach out and we love to talk to you. Cool. Thanks for coming in. Awesome. Thank\n\n[69:13] you for having me."

        "transcription": "[00:00] Xenofeminism, a politics for alienation, written by Laboria Kubonics. Read by Sen Naomi Kier-Schultz, June 25th, 2022.\n\n[00:15] Zero. Zero by zero. Ours is a world in vertigo. It is a world that swarms with technological mediation, interlacing our daily lives with abstraction, virtuality, and complexity.\n\n[00:31] Xenofeminism constructs a feminism adapted to these realities, a feminism of unprecedented cunning, scale, and vision. A future in which the realization of gender justice and feminist emancipation contribute to a universalist politics assembled from the needs of every human, cutting across race, ability, economic standing, and geographical position.\n\n[00:52] No more futureless repetition on the treadmill of capital, no more submission to the drudgery of labor, productive and reproductive alike, no more reification of the given masked as critique. Our future requires de-petrification. Xenofeminism is not a bid for revolution, but a wager on the long game of history, demanding imagination, dexterity, and persistence.\n\n[01:22] Zero by one.\n\n[01:25] Xenofeminism seizes alienation as an impetus to generate new worlds. We are all alienated, but have we ever been otherwise?\n\n[01:35] It is through and not despite our alienated condition that we can free ourselves from the muck of mediacy.\n\n[01:42] Freedom is not a given, and it's certainly not given by anything natural. The construction of freedom involves not less but more alienation. Alienation is the labor of freedom's construction.\n\n[01:55] Nothing should be accepted as fixed, permanent, or given. Neither material conditions nor social forms. Xenofeminism mutates, navigates, and probes every horizon.\n\n[02:08] Anyone who's been deemed unnatural in the face of reigning biological norms, anyone who's experienced injustices wrought in the name of natural order, will realize that the glorification of nature has nothing to offer us.\n\n[02:22] The queer and trans among us, the differently abled, as well as those who have suffered discrimination due to pregnancy or duties connected to child rearing.\n\n[02:31] Xenofeminism is vehemently anti-naturalist. Essentialist naturalism reeks of theology, and the sooner it is exercised, the better.\n\n[02:43] Zero by two.\n\n[02:45] Why is there so little explicit organized effort to repurpose technologies for progressive gender political ends?\n\n[02:52] Xenofeminism seeks to strategically deploy existing technologies to re-engineer the world. Serious risks are built into these tools. They are prone to imbalance, abuse, and exploitation of the weak.\n\n[03:05] Rather than pretending to risk nothing, xenofeminism advocates necessary assembly of techno-political interfaces responsive to these risks.\n\n[03:15] Technology isn't inherently progressive. Its uses are fused with culture in a positive feedback loop that makes linear sequencing, prediction, and absolute caution impossible.\n\n[03:28] Technoscientific innovation must be linked to a collective theoretical and political thinking in which women, queers, and the gender nonconforming play an unparalleled role.\n\n[03:41] Zero by three.\n\n[03:42] The real emancipatory potential of technology remains unrealized. Fed by the market, its rapid growth is offset by bloat, and elegant innovation is surrendered to the buyer whose stagnant world it decorates.\n\n[03:57] Beyond the noisy clutter of commodified cruft, the ultimate task lies in engineering technologies to combat unequal access to reproductive and pharmacological tools.\n\n[04:07] Environmental cataclysm, economic instability, as well as dangerous forms of unpaid or underpaid labor.\n\n[04:15] Gender inequality still characterizes the fields in which our technologies are conceived, built, and legislated for, while female workers in electronics, to name just one industry, perform some of the worst paid, monotonous, and debilitating labor.\n\n[04:30] Such injustice demands structural, machinic, and ideological correction.\n\n[04:39] Zero by four.\n\n[04:41] Xenofeminism is a rationalism. To claim that reason or rationality is by nature a patriarchal enterprise is to concede defeat.\n\n[04:52] It is true that the canonical history of thought is dominated by men, and in its male hands we see throttling existing institutions of science and technology.\n\n[05:01] But this is precisely why feminism must be a rationalism, because of this miserable imbalance and not despite it.\n\n[05:08] There is no feminine rationality, nor is there a masculine one. Science is not an expression, but a suspension of gender.\n\n[05:16] If today it is dominated by masculine egos, then it is at odds with itself, and this contradiction can be leveraged.\n\n[05:24] Reason, like information, wants to be free, and patriarchy cannot give it freedom.\n\n[05:30] Rationalism must itself be a feminism.\n\n[05:34] Xenofeminism marks the point where these claims intersect in a two-way dependency.\n\n[05:40] It names reason as an engine of feminist emancipation, and declares the right of everyone to speak, as no one in particular.\n\n[05:50] Interrupt.\n\n[05:52] Zero by five.\n\n[05:53] Zero by five.\n\n[05:56] The excess of modesty in feminist agendas of recent decades is not proportionate to the monstrous complexity of our reality,\n\n[06:04] a reality cross-hatched with fiber optic cables, radio and microwaves, oil and gas pipelines, aerial and shipping routes,\n\n[06:11] and the unrelenting simultaneous execution of millions of communication protocols with every passing millisecond.\n\n[06:19] Systematic thinking and structural analysis have largely fallen by the wayside in favor of admirable but insufficient struggles bound to fixed localities and fragmented insurrections.\n\n[06:32] While capitalism is understood as a complex and ever-expanding totality,\n\n[06:36] many would-be emancipatory, anti-capitalist projects remain profoundly fearful of transitioning to the universal,\n\n[06:44] resisting big-picture speculative politics by condemning them as necessarily oppressive vectors.\n\n[06:52] Such a false guarantee treats universals as absolute, generating a debilitating disjuncture between the thing we seek to depose and the strategies we advance to depose it.\n\n[07:03] Zero by six.\n\n[07:06] Global complexity opens us to urgent cognitive and ethical demands.\n\n[07:11] These are Promethean responsibilities that cannot pass unaddressed.\n\n[07:15] Much of 21st century feminism, from the remnants of postmodern identity politics to large swathes of contemporary ecofeminism,\n\n[07:25] struggles to adequately address these challenges in a manner capable of producing substantial and enduring change.\n\n[07:30] Xenofeminism endeavors to face up to these obligations as collective agents capable of transitioning between multiple levels of political, material, and conceptual organization.\n\n[07:43] Zero by seven.\n\n[07:45] We are adamantly synthetic, unsatisfied by analysis alone.\n\n[07:52] Xenofeminism urges constructive oscillation between description and prescription to mobilize the recursive potential of contemporary technologies upon gender, sexuality, and disparities of power.\n\n[08:05] Given that there are a range of gendered challenges specifically relating to life in a digital age,\n\n[08:10] from sexual harassment via social media to doxing, privacy, and the protection of online images,\n\n[08:16] the situation requires a feminism at ease with computation.\n\n[08:19] Today it is imperative that we develop an ideological infrastructure that both supports and facilitates feminist interventions within connective, networked elements of the contemporary world.\n\n[08:31] Xenofeminism is about more than digital self-defense and freedom from patriarchal networks.\n\n[08:37] We want to cultivate the exercise of positive freedom.\n\n[08:40] Freedom to rather than simply freedom from and urge feminists to equip themselves with the skills to redeploy existing technologies and invent novel cognitive and material tools in the service of common ends.\n\n[08:55] Zero by eight.\n\n[08:57] The radical opportunities afforded by the developing and alienating forms of technological mediation should no longer be put to use in the exclusive interests of capital, which by design only benefits the few.\n\n[09:09] There are incessantly proliferating tools to be annexed, and although no one can claim their comprehensive accessibility, digital tools have never been more widely available or more sensitive to appropriation than they are today.\n\n[09:23] This is not an illusion of the fact that a large amount of the world's poor is adversely affected by the expanding technological industry.\n\n[09:29] From factory workers laboring under abominable conditions, the Ghanaian villages have become a repository for the e-waste of the global powers.\n\n[09:39] But an explicit acknowledgement of these conditions as a target for elimination.\n\n[09:44] Just as the invention of the stock market was also the invention of the crash, Xenofeminism knows that technological innovation must equally anticipate its systemic condition responsibly.\n\n[09:56] Section. Trap.\n\n[09:59] Zero by nine.\n\n[10:01] Xenofeminism rejects illusion and melancholy as political inhibitors.\n\n[10:06] Illusion, as the blind presumption that the weak can prevail over the strong with no strategic coordination, leads to unfulfilled promises and unmarshalled drives.\n\n[10:16] This is a politics that in wanting so much ends up building so little.\n\n[10:21] Without the labor of large scale collective social organization, declaring one's desire for global change is nothing more than wishful thinking.\n\n[10:29] On the other hand, melancholy so endemic to the left teaches us that emancipation is an extinct species to be wept over and that blips of negation are the best we can hope for.\n\n[10:41] At its worst, such an attitude generates nothing but political lassitude and at its best installs an atmosphere of pervasive despair, which too often degenerates into factionalism and petty moralizing.\n\n[10:54] The malady of melancholia only compounds political inertia and under the guise of being realistic relinquishes all hope of calibrating the world otherwise.\n\n[11:04] It is against such maladies that Xenofeminism inoculates.\n\n[11:11] Zero by A.\n\n[11:14] We take politics that exclusively valorize the local in the guise of subverting currents of global abstraction to be insufficient.\n\n[11:22] To secede from or disavow capitalist machinery will not make it disappear.\n\n[11:27] Likewise, suggestions to pull the lever on the emergency break of embedded velocities, the call to slow down and scale back, is a possibility available only to the few, a violent particularity of exclusivity, ultimately entailing catastrophe for the many.\n\n[11:43] Refusing to think beyond the micro community to foster connections between fractured insurgencies to consider how emancipatory tactics can be scaled up for universal implementation is to remain satisfied with temporary and defensive gestures.\n\n[11:59] Xenofeminism is an affirmative creature on the offensive, fiercely insisting on the possibility of large-scale social change for all of our alien kin.\n\n[12:10] Zero by Zero B.\n\n[12:13] A sense of the world's volatility and artificiality seems to have faded from contemporary queer and feminist politics in favor of a plural but static constellation of gender identities in whose bleak light equations of the good and the natural are stubbornly restored, while having perhaps admirably expanded thresholds of tolerance.\n\n[12:34] Too often we are told to seek solace in unfreedom, staking claims on being born this way, as if offering an excuse with nature's blessing.\n\n[12:44] All the while, the heteronormative center chugs on.\n\n[12:48] Xenofeminism challenges the centrifugal referent, knowing full well that sex and gender are exemplary of the fulcrum between norm and fact, between freedom and compulsion.\n\n[13:00] To tilt the fulcrum in the direction of nature is a defensive concession at best, and to retreat from what makes trans and queer politics more than just a lobby, that it is an arduous assertion of freedom against an order that seemed immutable.\n\n[13:15] Like every myth of the given, a stable foundation is fabulated for a real world of chaos, violence, and doubt.\n\n[13:23] The given is sequestered into the private realm as a certainty, whilst retreating on fronts of public consequences.\n\n[13:31] When the possibility of transition became real and known, the tomb under nature's shrine cracked, and new histories bristling with futures escaped the old order of sex.\n\n[13:43] The disciplinary grid of gender is in no small part an attempt to mend that shattered foundation, and tame the lives that escaped it.\n\n[13:52] The time has now come to tear down this shrine entirely and not bow down before it in a piteous apology for what little autonomy has been won.\n\n[14:03] Zero by C\n\n[14:06] If cyberspace once offered the promise of escaping the strictures of essentialist identity categories, the climate of contemporary social media has swung forcefully in the other direction as become a theater where these prostrations to identity are performed.\n\n[14:21] With these curatorial practices come puritanical rituals of moral maintenance, and these stages are too often overrun with the disavowed pleasures of accusation, shaming, and denunciation.\n\n[14:36] Valuable platforms for connection, organization, and skill sharing become clogged with obstacles to productive debate, positioned as if they are debate.\n\n[14:46] These puritanical politics of shame, which fetishize oppression as if it were a blessing and cloud the waters in moralistic frenzies, leave us cold.\n\n[14:55] We want neither clean hands nor beautiful souls, neither virtue nor terror. We want superior forms of corruption.\n\n[15:04] Zero by Zero D\n\n[15:07] What this shows is that the task of engineering platforms for social emancipation and organization cannot ignore the cultural and semiotic mutations these platforms afford.\n\n[15:17] What requires re-engineering are the mimetic parasites arousing and coordinating behaviors in ways occluded by their host's self-image.\n\n[15:25] Failing this, memes like anonymity, ethics, social justice, and privilege checking host social dynamisms at odds with the often commendable intentions with which they are taken up.\n\n[15:37] The task of collective self-mastery requires a hyperstitional manipulation of the desires' puppet strings, and deployment of semiotic operators over a terrain of highly networked cultural systems.\n\n[15:50] The will will always be corrupted by the memes in which it traffics, but nothing prevents us from instrumentalizing this fact and calibrating it in view of the ends it desires.\n\n[16:04] Parody\n\n[16:07] Zero by Zero E\n\n[16:10] Xenofeminism is gender abolitionist.\n\n[16:14] Gender abolitionism is not code for the eradication of what are currently considered gendered traits from the human population.\n\n[16:21] Under patriarchy, such a project could only spell disaster. The notion of what is gendered sticks disproportionately to the feminine.\n\n[16:30] But even if this balance were redressed, we have no interest in seeing the sex-wit diversity of the world reduced.\n\n[16:36] Let a hundred sexes bloom. Gender abolitionism is shorthand for the ambition to construct a society where traits currently assembled under the rubric of gender no longer furnish a grid for the asymmetric operation of power.\n\n[16:51] Race abolitionism expands into a similar formula, that the struggle must continue until currently racialized characteristics are no more a basis of discrimination than the color of one's eyes.\n\n[17:03] Ultimately, every emancipatory abolitionism must incline towards the horizon of class abolitionism, since it is in capitalism where we encounter oppression in its transparent, denaturalized form.\n\n[17:18] You are not exploited or oppressed because you are a wage laborer or poor. You are a laborer or poor because you are exploited.\n\n[17:26] Xenofeminism understands that the viability of emancipatory abolitionist projects, the abolition of class, gender, and race, hinges on a profound reworking of the universal.\n\n[17:40] The universal must be grasped as generic, which is to say intersectional.\n\n[17:46] Intersectionality is not the morselation of collectives into a static fuzz of cross-referenced identities, but a political orientation that slices through every particular, refusing the crass pigeonholing of bodies.\n\n[18:01] This is not a universal that can be imposed from above but built from the bottom up, or better, laterally, opening new lines of transit across an uneven landscape.\n\n[18:12] This non-absolute, generic universality must guard against the facile tendency of conflation with bloated, unmarked particulars, namely, Eurocentric universalism, whereby the male is mistaken for the sexless, the white for the raceless, the cis for the real, and so on.\n\n[18:33] Absent such a universal, the abolition of class will remain a bourgeoisie fantasy, the abolition of race will remain a tacit white supremacism, and the abolition of gender will remain a thinly veiled misogyny, even and especially when prosecuted by avowed feminists themselves.\n\n[18:51] The absurd and reckless spectacle of so many self-proclaimed gender abolitionists' campaign against trans women is proof enough of this.\n\n[19:06] From the postmoderns, we have learnt to burn the facades of the false universal and dispel such confusions.\n\n[19:13] From the moderns, we have learnt to sift new universals from the ashes of the false.\n\n[19:19] Xenofeminism seeks to construct a collisional politics, a politics without the infection of purity.\n\n[19:26] Wielding the universal requires thoughtful qualification and precise self-reflection, so as to become a ready-to-hand tool for multiple political bodies and something that can be appropriated against the numerous oppressions that transact with gender and sexuality.\n\n[19:43] The universal is no blueprint, and rather than dictate its uses in advance, we propose xenofeminism as a platform.\n\n[19:52] The very process of construction is therefore understood to be a negantropic, iterative, and continual refashioning.\n\n[20:01] Xenofeminism seeks to be a mutable architecture that, like open-source software, remains available for perpetual modification and enhancement following the navigational impulse of militant ethical reasoning.\n\n[20:15] Open, however, does not mean undirected.\n\n[20:20] The most durable systems in the world owe their stability to the way they train order to emerge as an invisible hand from apparent spontaneity, or exploit the inertia of investment and sedimentation.\n\n[20:31] We should not hesitate to learn from our adversaries, or the successes and failures of history.\n\n[20:38] With this in mind, xenofeminism seeks ways to seed an order that is equitable and just, injecting it into the geometry of freedoms these platforms afford.\n\n[20:50] Section. Adjust.\n\n[20:53] Zero by Eleven.\n\n[20:56] Our lot is cast with technoscience, where nothing is so sacred that it cannot be re-engineered and transformed so as to widen our aperture of freedom, extending to gender and the human.\n\n[21:09] To say that nothing is sacred, that nothing is transcendent or protected from the will to know, to tinker and to hack is to say that nothing is supernatural.\n\n[21:20] Nature, quote-unquote, understood here as the unbounded arena of science, is all there is.\n\n[21:28] And so, in tearing down melancholy and illusion, the unambitious and the non-scalable, the libidinized puritanism of certain online cultures, and nature as an unremarkable given, we find that our normative anti-naturalism has pushed us towards an unflinching ontological naturalism.\n\n[21:47] There is nothing, we claim, that cannot be studied scientifically and manipulated technologically.\n\n[21:55] Zero by Twelve.\n\n[21:58] This does not mean that the distinction between the ontological and the normative, between fact and value, is simply cut and dried.\n\n[22:06] The vectors of normative anti-naturalism and ontological naturalism span many ambivalent battlefields.\n\n[22:12] The project of untangling what ought to be from what is, of dissociating freedom from fact, will from knowledge, is indeed an infinite task.\n\n[22:22] There are many lacuna where desire confronts us with the brutality of fact, where beauty is indissociable from truth.\n\n[22:30] Poetry, sex, technology, and pain are incandescent with this tension we have traced.\n\n[22:37] But give up on the task of revision, release the reins, and slacken that tension, and these filaments instantly dim.\n\n[22:47] Section. Carry.\n\n[22:50] Zero by Thirteen.\n\n[22:53] The potential of early text-based internet culture for countering repressive gender regimes, generating solidarity among marginalized groups, and creating new spaces for experimentation that ignited cyberfeminism in the 90s has clearly waned in the 21st century.\n\n[23:11] The dominance of the visual in today's online interfaces has reinstated familiar modes of identity policing, power relations, and gender norms and self-representation.\n\n[23:19] But this does not mean that cyberfeminist sensibilities belong in the past.\n\n[23:25] Sorting the subversive possibilities from the oppressive ones latent in today's web requires a feminism sensitive to the insidious return of old power structures, yet savvy enough to know how to exploit the potential.\n\n[23:38] Digital technologies are not separable from the material realities that underwrite them. They are connected so that each can be used to alter the other towards different ends.\n\n[23:49] Rather than arguing for the primacy of the virtual over the material, or the material over the virtual, xenofeminism grasps points of power and powerlessness in both to unfold this knowledge as effective interventions in our jointly composed reality.\n\n[24:04] 0 by 14. Intervention in more obviously material hegemonies is just as crucial as intervention in digital and cultural ones.\n\n[24:15] Changes to the built environment harbor some of the most significant possibilities in the reconfiguration of the horizons of women and queers.\n\n[24:23] As the embodiment of ideological constellations, the production of space and the decisions we make for its organizations are ultimately articulations about us and reciprocally how a we can be articulated.\n\n[24:37] With the potential to foreclose, restrict, or open up future social conditions, xenofeminists must become attuned to the language of architecture as a vocabulary to the\n\n[24:47] collective choreography, the coordinated writing of space.\n\n[24:52] 0 by 15. From the street to the home, domestic space too must not escape our tentacles. So profoundly ingrained, domestic space has been deemed impossible to disembed, where the home as norm has been conflated with home as fact as an unremarkable given.\n\n[25:04] Stultifying domestic realism has no home on our horizon. Let us set sights on augmented homes of shared laboratories of communal media and technical facilities.\n\n[25:17] The home is ripe for spatial transformation, and the\n\n[25:29] But this cannot stop at the garden gates. We see too well that reinventions of family structure and domestic life are currently only possible at the cost of either withdrawing from the economic sphere, the way of the commune, or bearing its burdens manyfold, the way of the single parent.\n\n[25:39] If we want to break the inertia that has kept the moribund figure of the nuclear family unit in place, which has stubbornly worked to isolate women from the public sector, we must be able to do so.\n\n[26:09] If we want to break the economic sphere and men from the lives of their children while penalizing those who stray from it, we must overhaul the material infrastructure and break the economic cycles that lock it in place.\n\n[26:22] The task before us is twofold, and our vision necessarily stereoscopic.\n\n[26:28] We must engineer an economy that liberates reproductive labor and family life while building models of familiarity, familiarity, free from the deadening grind of wage labor.\n\n[26:41] 0 by 16.\n\n[27:11] The rise of the internet and the hydra of black market pharmacies it let loose, together with a publicly accessible archive endocrinological know-how, was instrumental in wresting control of the hormonal economy away from gatekeeping institutions seeking to mitigate threats to establish distributions of the sexual.\n\n[27:31] To trade in the rule of bureaucrats, for the market is, however, not victory in itself.\n\n[27:37] These tides need to rise higher.\n\n[27:40] We ask whether the idiom of gender hacking is extensible into a long-range strategy, a strategy for wetware akin to what hacker culture has already done for software,\n\n[27:51] constructing an entire universe of free and open source platforms that is the closest thing to practicable communism many of us have ever seen.\n\n[28:02] Without the foolhardy endangerment of lives, can we stitch together the embryonic promises held before us by pharmaceutical 3D printing, reactionware, grassroots telemedical abortion clinics, gender hacktivist and DIY HRT forums and so on, to assemble a platform for free and open source medicine?\n\n[28:23] 0 by 17.\n\n[28:24] From the global to the local, from the cloud to our bodies, xenofeminism avows the responsibility in constructing new institutions of techno-materialist hegemonic proportions.\n\n[28:36] Like engineers who must conceive of a total structure as well as the molecular parts from which it is constructed, xenofeminism emphasizes the importance of the meso-political sphere against the limited effectiveness of local gestures,\n\n[28:52] creation of autonomous zones and sheer horizontalism, just as it stands against transcendent or top-down impositions of values and norms.\n\n[29:02] The meso-political arena of xenofeminism's universalist ambitions comprehends itself as a mobile and intricate network of transits between these polarities.\n\n[29:13] As pragmatists, we invite contamination as a mutational driver between such frontiers.\n\n[29:19] Section. Overflow.\n\n[29:21] 0 by 18.\n\n[29:23] Xenofeminism asserts that adapting our behavior for an era of Promethean complexity is a labor requiring patience, but a ferocious patience at odds with waiting.\n\n[29:35] Calibrating a political hegemony or insurgent memeplex not only implies the creation of material infrastructures to make the values it articulates explicit, but also to create a new set of structures.\n\n[29:49] But places demands on us as subjects.\n\n[29:52] How are we to become hosts of this new world?\n\n[29:56] How do we build a better semiotic parasite, one that arouses the desires we want to desire, that orchestrates not an autophagic orgy of indignity or rage, but an emancipatory and egalitarian community buttressed by new forms of unselfish solidarity and collective self-mastery?\n\n[30:17] 0 by 19.\n\n[30:19] Is Xenofeminism a program?\n\n[30:22] Not if this means anything so crude as a recipe or a single purpose tool by which a determinate problem is solved.\n\n[30:31] We prefer to think like the schemer or lisp-er who seeks to construct a new language in which the problem at hand is immersed, so that solutions for it and for any number of related problems might unfurl with ease.\n\n[30:45] Xenofeminism is a platform, an incipient ambition to construct a new language for sexual politics, a language that seizes its own methods as materials to be reworked and incrementally bootstraps itself into existence.\n\n[31:01] We understand that the problems we face are systemic and interlocking, and that any chance of global success depends on infecting myriad skills in context with the logic of xenofeminism.\n\n[31:14] Ours is a transformation of seeping, directed subsumption rather than rapid overthrow.\n\n[31:21] It is a transformation of deliberate construction, seeking to submerge the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy in a sea of procedures that soften its shell and dismantle its defenses so as to build a new world from the scraps.\n\n[31:38] 0 by 1A.\n\n[31:39] Xenofeminism indexes the desire to construct an alien future with a triumphant X on a mobile map.\n\n[31:47] This X does not mark a destination. It is the insertion of a topological keyframe for the formation of a new logic.\n\n[31:56] In affirming a future untethered to the repetition of the present, we militate for ampliative capacities, for spaces of freedom with a richer geometry, the aisle, the assembly line, and the feed.\n\n[32:12] We need new affordances of perception and action, unblinkered by naturalized identities.\n\n[32:18] In the name of feminism, nature shall no longer be a refuge of injustice or a basis for any political justification whatsoever. If nature is unjust, then change nature.\n\n[32:33] This has been Xenofeminism, a politics for alienation, written by Laboria Kubonics.\n\n[32:40] Read by Sen Naomi Kier Schultz, June 25th, 2022."

        "transcription": "[00:00] Hi everyone, welcome to Flosside's Biotech and Health Extension Seminar series sponsored by\n\n[00:06] 100 Plus Capital. Really happy to have so many of you here. Not surprised given today's guest.\n\n[00:14] Before we hop into today's discussion, I just want to remind people that if you are still interested\n\n[00:20] in joining us for Vision Weekend, which is our annual member gathering, there are still applications\n\n[00:25] open for subsidized attendance. We're going to be in San Francisco. You're going to have the chance\n\n[00:30] to meet lots of people from this biotech and rejuvenation track, but also across different\n\n[00:36] tracks. We're going to be not only in San Francisco, but also at a castle in France,\n\n[00:40] and there'll be some intermingling between the different venues as well. And so if you want to\n\n[00:46] basically meet top folks in this group, but also across different groups and from throughout the\n\n[00:52] year, this is like a really wonderful opportunity to get together in person. Great, I'm going to\n\n[00:57] share more in this chat. There are application-based tickets available, so we have the ability to\n\n[01:02] subsidize a lot of your guys' attendance, and it would be wonderful to see in person.\n\n[01:06] Cool, so for today, we're so happy to actually re-welcome George Church here. So I went, when\n\n[01:14] I discovered Flosside about like 10 years ago, just before when I joined, I went into our archives,\n\n[01:19] and I found, George, you've given a really wonderful presentation to Flosside before,\n\n[01:23] quite a while back, and much of the technology is still really as relevant as when you discussed it\n\n[01:30] back then already. I think apart from that, you really need no further introduction. Everyone here,\n\n[01:35] I think, is well aware of your work, of your countless startups. I don't think I've really\n\n[01:39] met anyone else who spun up so many projects in the biotech and rejuvenation area. I'm going to\n\n[01:45] share much more about you in the chat in case people want to read up the growing list of your\n\n[01:50] endeavors. But for now, I'm super delighted, honored to have you here, and I'm going to give\n\n[01:56] it up to you now, because I know that we're going to struggle at the end of the seminar in time when\n\n[02:01] people want to get their questions in. So thank you so, so much for joining. We're thrilled to\n\n[02:06] have you here, and the stage is yours. Okay, great. Yeah, hopefully there'll be plenty of time for\n\n[02:15] questions and answers, because I'm just going to give a representative a couple of examples,\n\n[02:25] and I think some of you know other things that I do that you can ask about, or about the things\n\n[02:34] I talk about. So I'm going to share my screen. There it is, Foresight. It must be in the right place.\n\n[02:45] Okay, so I work on, I think a number of things relevant to the Foresight Institute, but I must\n\n[02:55] focus partly at the prompting of the organizers that to on gene and cell therapies for age-related,\n\n[03:04] we're essentially reversing age-related and infectious diseases. Full conflict of interest\n\n[03:13] on this website down the lower right, and there you go.\n\n[03:21] So I want to mention, announce in a certain sense of a pre-print. So this is hot off the presses,\n\n[03:30] where we think we have a way of making any organism resistant to all viruses.\n\n[03:37] We've done it for one organism, I think pretty convincing, including just taking random\n\n[03:42] viruses out of the environment that we know nothing about, thousands of them, and it's\n\n[03:49] resistant, and for good reason it's on paper as well. And then that's part of a bigger plan to make\n\n[03:58] enhanced organs that are enhanced in various ways. So not just to deal with the organ shortage,\n\n[04:06] which is killing people, but to make those organs as good as they can be, including germline\n\n[04:12] engineering, but germline engineering of animals, of humus. But in the care of humus.\n\n[04:23] So then all of the above is made possible in multiplex editing, and I'll talk about the\n\n[04:32] dark matter of the genome and how that applies to aging reversal as well. So we are in exponential\n\n[04:41] times, and I think my group has contributed at least as much as any other in both the reading\n\n[04:47] and writing of DNA, which has improved about 20 million fold in cost and a little less than that\n\n[04:54] in quality. And it continues to go exponential, but many years going faster than Moore's law,\n\n[05:03] two to tenfold improvement per year. And this is I think large-sigil multiplexing, that would be a\n\n[05:10] full-dollar different talk. But today instead we'd like to talk about how it is we make decisions\n\n[05:22] for therapeutics or TX for gene therapy, cell therapy, molecular and protein therapies.\n\n[05:29] My lab and our spin-off companies work on all four of those. But in particular, I want to\n\n[05:37] justify gene therapy a little bit. And some of the advantages are on the far left-hand column here.\n\n[05:46] In principle, it can be once in a lifetime rather than taking a pill every day for the\n\n[05:52] rest of your life or taking hundreds of pills, we're saying every day for the rest of your life.\n\n[05:57] This is once and done theory anyway. It is very smart at the delivery system.\n\n[06:05] You know, almost no other form of drugs is capable of chemotaxis, for example.\n\n[06:13] That's something that's really unique to cell therapies.\n\n[06:20] And the mechanism of action that most medical research contributes to is\n\n[06:30] an easy stepping point between that basic research and gene therapy.\n\n[06:39] We typically these days collect information that's formulated in terms of proteins and genes behind\n\n[06:46] them. It's a very low off target. For example, we have a big multi-gene family that are closely\n\n[06:52] related evolutionarily. It's hard to target, like kinases say, hard to target one with a drug,\n\n[06:59] not the others. Well, you can make not only discriminate multi-gene family members but\n\n[07:06] alleles specific meaning, person specific and splice form specific. So it's very\n\n[07:16] easy to achieve that. And finally, it can be low cost and I'll mention that\n\n[07:20] in more detail right here on this slide. So gene therapies aimed at rare diseases,\n\n[07:28] including Joel Zinsma and the new record holder is $2.8 million a dose. Joel Zinsma was for\n\n[07:37] spinal myths or atropine. The new one is for hemoglobinopathies. Those are cost effective,\n\n[07:45] as high as that price tag is for dose. But I, having helped with the exponentials and reading,\n\n[07:54] writing, DNA would like to see the therapeutics go down in cost. And in fact, if you look at\n\n[08:02] the formulation that is very similar to gene therapy, essentially molecular and identical,\n\n[08:09] almost never called that, is the most recent vaccine round was COVID. All five of the top\n\n[08:17] five words was formulated from gene therapy methods, including viral capsids and double\n\n[08:24] stranded DNA payload in three of them and messenger RNA and lipid nanoparticles for the other two.\n\n[08:34] And all of them were inexpensive, the cheapest being about $2 a dose compared to $2.8 million.\n\n[08:41] Okay, so multivirus resistance. So the last slide was kind of playing with viruses, both friends\n\n[08:50] and foes use these virus capsid to produce a vaccine that protects you against another virus,\n\n[09:00] A, against COVID coronavirus. But here is making multivirus resistance, essentially in one's\n\n[09:07] own way. So we've been working on this since around 2004. Here's some of the papers and some\n\n[09:14] of the people that participated in that. But I'm going to jump ahead to what we just did in this\n\n[09:21] preprint in bioarchive. And I'm going to jump ahead to the data that we have here. So here's\n\n[09:29] the data that we have here. So here's the data that we have here. So here's the data that we have\n\n[09:33] here.

than germline engineering,\n\n[15:24] But it is inspired by natural and previous experiments,\n\n[15:30] Mostly in mice, but now transferred to pigs.\n\n[15:34] They are naturally resistant to many human pathogens,\n\n[15:38] Bacterial, fungal, and viral.\n\n[15:44] In addition we have the methods that I mentioned before that we'd like to transfer.\n\n[15:48] There are two methods known for getting cancer and senescence resistance in mice that we would like to.\n\n[15:56] We would not want our organs to succumb to cancer or senescence if we can avoid it.\n\n[16:04] I've already mentioned immunity in the previous slide.\n\n[16:10] We're interested in cryopreservation, dehydration, and damage for a variety of reasons.\n\n[16:18] One of them is that these are related to aging.\n\n[16:24] The other is that they are related to storage of the organs.\n\n[16:30] Here's a couple of organisms that have extreme resistance to cholera and pseudoprime preservation,\n\n[16:38] Including salamander, which goes for over 45 days at minus 55.\n\n[16:44] We'd like to get that working for organs in general via germline engineering.\n\n[16:52] We also have a proof of concept.\n\n[16:54] The virus resistance is done in E. coli, so it's still a ways to go before we have it working in mammals.\n\n[17:02] Nevertheless, this is work that inspires us rather than from our lab.\n\n[17:10] We have 10 to the fourth, 10 to the fifth fold improvement in radiation resistance\n\n[17:16] in this normally non-radiation resistant organism with just four mutations.\n\n[17:22] This is very encouraging for things that we're trying to do in parallel on human cells.\n\n[17:30] One of the things that constitutes genome damage in addition to radiation caused genome damage\n\n[17:42] is jumping genes, or transposable elements.\n\n[17:48] I've already talked about one kind of that, which is the endogenous retrovirus,\n\n[17:54] but even more pervasive example are these long interspersed and short interspersed nuclear elements,\n\n[18:04] or jumping genes, and these lines and signs have been kind of a part of the dark matter of the genome.\n\n[18:14] It made it hard to sequence genomes, much less study them genetically,\n\n[18:18] but we think we have a breakthrough on that that I'll share with you in just a moment.\n\n[18:22] But first, to just document some of the recent articles,\n\n[18:26] by no means a comprehensive review of articles that have shown or indicated\n\n[18:34] that these categories of dark matter, repetitive DNA in the genome,\n\n[18:40] are involved in aging if inflammation is damaging and related degenerative diseases.\n\n[18:52] We're tackling essentially every category of repetitive elements,\n\n[18:58] and have recently increased our target from endogenous retroviruses,\n\n[19:05] which were around 20 to 80 copies per genome, to line elements, which are 24,000 copies per genome,\n\n[19:12] to centromeres and sign elements, which are in the millions per genome.\n\n[19:17] And it seems crazy from our perspective, and just a few years ago,\n\n[19:22] it was hard to do one gene at a time to now be talking about thousands to millions,\n\n[19:31] but I'll show you a little bit more about that.\n\n[19:35] So here's an example where we took human pluripotent stem cells,\n\n[19:39] which are actually from my body, and attack and saturated all of the line elements in that using deaminases,\n\n[19:55] both cytidine C to T and A to G.\n\n[19:59] We far prefer the A to G, it has less off-target, it has less toxicity.\n\n[20:03] I should mention that anything more severe than deamination,\n\n[20:08] where we're just basically changing a nitrogen to an oxygen in a water-mediated reaction,\n\n[20:18] anything more than that, like a nick, even a mere nick, much less a double-strand break,\n\n[20:23] at this level of simultaneous editing is immediately deadly.\n\n[20:28] So we have to get everything right so that we have factors that prevent apoptosis\n\n[20:34] and prevent various kinds of repair that can result in double-strand breaks.\n\n[20:39] We do all of that right.\n\n[20:41] Raphael and Shunting and Corey in particular are carrying this on.\n\n[20:48] We have another paper ready to be submitted that follows up on this NAR paper.\n\n[20:54] And we have essentially all of the active, the ones that aren't completely crusted over in the genome,\n\n[21:03] we can saturate, we can get every one of them with this deamination method.\n\n[21:10] Now applying, putting all that together with what is known about aging,\n\n[21:17] I would maintain that a great deal is known.\n\n[21:22] There's kind of a half empty, half full, but I think we have enough known\n\n[21:26] that we can start turning it into therapies in the same, a lot, so much more is known\n\n[21:33] than how much was known about, say, smallpox when we started doing smallpox vaccines.\n\n[21:38] We didn't know anything about virology or immunology at all.\n\n[21:42] But anyway, we know all of the, there's ten major hallmarks and a set of biochemical pathways\n\n[21:50] that go with each of these mitochondrial, floric restriction, telomeres, things that you've all heard.\n\n[22:00] These are now all targets for drug development and all a few of some,\n\n[22:05] I think, cutting edge things that we're doing.\n\n[22:08] So that ten goalposts are represented in an interconnected set of reactions,\n\n[22:17] which can be layered on top of the cell, in this case,\n\n[22:25] with the extracellular media on the top of the slide,\n\n[22:30] and then a membrane and transmembrane proteins next level down the cytoplasm,\n\n[22:36] the nucleus at the bottom, and mitochondria, endoplasmic,\n\n[22:41] and other organelles on the side here.\n\n[22:43] And each of these has these enzymes, regulatory proteins and RNAs that are well characterized\n\n[22:50] and many of them have our drug targets or are subject to gene therapy.\n\n[22:56] I'm going to pick out three of them that we used in multi-gene therapy\n\n[22:59] because these had the characteristic not of being down here in the genome,\n\n[23:05] we've also done the Yamanaka stem cell factors that you may know about.\n\n[23:10] This is a popular topic because they do literally reverse aging from, say,\n\n[23:17] 80-year-old fibroblasts or blood cells to embryonic.\n\n[23:22] So it's an enormous reversal.\n\n[23:25] But it's hard to deliver.\n\n[23:27] It's possibly hard to keep it in line in the diverse set of tissues it's starting in.\n\n[23:35] But instead, we looked at what was inspired by so-called young blood,\n\n[23:40] where the various factors that have been uncharacterized\n\n[23:45] for most of the years that this has been done.\n\n[23:48] Here we picked three that were likely candidates for that sort of phenomenon,\n\n[23:52] which I'll show you.\n\n[23:53] So these are now indicated with these red, blue, yellow arrows.\n\n[23:59] We have fibrograst, both like group 21, alpha-clotho and TGF-beta receptor.\n\n[24:09] I think the important thing here is these are either soluble or can be made soluble,\n\n[24:14] and we tested them in all possible combinations\n\n[24:16] as it was Venn diagrams about and to see whether any of them interfered with one another,\n\n[24:22] whether they resulted in aging reversal as I said on aging diseases,\n\n[24:29] not just biomarkers like DNA methylation or RNA transcriptome,\n\n[24:34] but actually multiple diseases.\n\n[24:37] And I'll show you an example of taking from the paper in PNAS.\n\n[24:43] Noah Davidson was a post-doctoral fellow in my lab and then became co-founder of Rejuvenate Biome,\n\n[24:50] which is applying this both veterinary and human.\n\n[24:55] It started with mice in this paper, and dogs is in clinical trials now for veterinary products.\n\n[25:02] These people have won a few of all years with their pets,\n\n[25:08] but then it's also prelude to human clinical trials because it's looking very good in animals so far.\n\n[25:15] Anyway, so this first paper addressed four different diseases that are age-related.\n\n[25:23] Almost every disease has some age-related component, even falling down and not getting out,\n\n[25:30] and COVID-19 and the cognitive consequences are all very steeply increased with age.\n\n[25:37] But here, one of the disease models for accelerated aging or starting with pre-age mice\n\n[25:48] is we can accelerate the age-related weight increase to the point of morbid obesity\n\n[25:57] and then restore it with this serious combination of photophotos on the left here,\n\n[26:08] where it doesn't just keep going to the point of muscle wasting and loss in abnormal interrexia\n\n[26:21] or something like that, but it levels off at a normal level.\n\n[26:25] And then diabetes is another one disease model where insulin tolerance tests, etc. can be improved.\n\n[26:35] You can see the same cocktail of drugs is working for both of these and is also working here,\n\n[26:45] not the colors, but the names to the factors for a kidney loss model of unilateral obstruction.\n\n[26:59] And we have another one on heart disease.\n\n[27:02] And Noah Davidson, who was the star of that show, was also involved in a total of three out of those four papers,\n\n[27:10] all of which used AAV, the smallest viral vector for delivery.\n\n[27:16] He was not involved in the cytomegalovirus study, which had one of the biggest viruses for delivery.\n\n[27:24] Even bigger delivery that we do is via cell delivery rather than viral.\n\n[27:29] But in any case, it was basically AAV is about five kilovases, cytomegalovirus about 100 kilovases,\n\n[27:35] and the cells can deliver gigabases.\n\n[27:39] So I mentioned the Yamanaka factors here, OSKM, we use three of them, OS and K.\n\n[27:47] I mentioned the three below, and then telomerase and folistatin were used in this slide.\n\n[27:55] I'll show you the next slide.\n\n[27:58] And now the list of diseases is eight different diseases and keeps growing.\n\n[28:06] Basically, if we can get something that one cocktail of drugs hits all these different pathways,\n\n[28:13] we're probably getting close to the core of aging.\n\n[28:16] And it's easy to get, much easier to get disapproves than something that deals with longevity\n\n[28:24] because our variation in longevity is so great in the population.\n\n[28:28] We have to do a multi-tech-based trial to be convincing, and that's too long and too expensive.\n\n[28:37] So even though we do go to the FDA with reversal-specific age-related diseases,\n\n[28:43] if we get any of them, essentially we have an approved drug that could get all of them.\n\n[28:48] But here's one where we did collect some longevity data.\n\n[28:51] It wasn't the primary goal. It just fell right out.\n\n[28:55] This is, again, this large site of megavirus delivering either telomerase or folistatin genes.\n\n[29:02] And you can see here the wild type mice control on the far left, dying early, whose death,\n\n[29:09] probably early death, observe, not theoretical.\n\n[29:16] And then two different genes, telomerase and folistatin, way far on the right,\n\n[29:24] showing non-overlapping death births and inspired by previous literature.\n\n[29:31] So I know I went through that pretty quickly, but I know there's also many questions to be asked in the Q&A.\n\n[29:41] And since so many people showed up, thank you. I'm going to open it up to that.\n\n[29:45] But just to quickly review, I fear the pre-print where we think we have resistance to all viruses\n\n[29:52] in one cell type, which we are actively now trying to repeat that in pigs and human cells, human stem cells.\n\n[30:04] I described a number of ways we can enhance organs only for pathogens, immunity, prior preservation, cancerous innocence.\n\n[30:14] And then a lot of this has been helped by multiplex editing, which now is at crazy levels\n\n[30:21] of at least 24,000 and we're working on a repeat family that's in the millions,\n\n[30:29] which can also be leveraged for other things.\n\n[30:32] It's, for example, recording of information, which we have done as well.\n\n[30:39] And then finally, this aging reversal, which offers a way of getting it among the most general\n\n[30:47] and possibly cheapest category of therapies.\n\n[30:52] It's cheap because the market size is large, like as it is for pandemics.\n\n[30:57] But this might be even larger market size because everybody is impacted by aging.\n\n[31:04] So we hope to make that accessible to all. So period. Full stop. I'll stop sharing. Thank you.\n\n[31:13] Oh, fantastic. Thank you so, so much. We're not going to do this thing where everyone mutes and claps.\n\n[31:19] We have too little time. I mean, it goes to a lot of questions, but this was a really great.\n\n[31:25] Yeah, well, I feel like you're doing it anyway, but this was really, really great and such a wonderful trajectory\n\n[31:32] through the entire field and then like ending on long jumping. So thanks a lot. That was really, really useful.\n\n[31:37] We already have one hand raised here by Micah, so I'll take you first and then we'll move on to the next.\n\n[31:43] So raise your hand now or say a question in the chat and we'll get you as fast as we can.\n\n[31:49] You briefly mentioned using cell delivery of gene therapies.\n\n[31:54] Can you give like the very short elevator explanation of what that is? I'm familiar with it. It's like Aav viruses, CMV, and you've got the DV dumbbells.\n\n[32:02] I haven't heard of cell delivery though.\n\n[32:05] Ah, right. Well, that's that's because it's not as far along.\n\n[32:11] Although the category of self therapies is often you can think of it as you can do ex vivo gene therapy on say hematopoietic stem cells,\n\n[32:22] reintroduce them into the body and in a purple it they contribute to the entire they go into the body, including chemotaxis.\n\n[32:36] So that's that's one way. Another way says where the cells are there, the delivery package themselves and have\n\n[32:46] a large payload of genomic material is edited or engineered.\n\n[32:52] It also since the viral capsules that we use for gene therapy are made in cells, it is possible, although not yet demonstrated, that you can make them in situ in body in the right place.\n\n[33:08] So you have the combination of the cells that can chemotaxis or otherwise find the correct location plus the viral specificity.\n\n[33:18] That's what I'm trying to do.\n\n[33:24] You just inject into the person more or less.\n\n[33:27] You also have the option of injecting it selectively.\n\n[33:32] So if you want to have both anatomical and bio visible targeting.\n\n[33:38] Yes, but you could also do it systemically and in fact, all the gene therapies that I've talked about so far for aging or systemic delivery through intravenous.\n\n[33:53] Wonderful. You got a thumbs up.\n\n[33:56] Question answered. Thank you. Next one.\n\n[34:03] First, thank you so much, Dr. Church. That was very informative.\n\n[34:07] And I wanted to ask about the question in terms of the gene therapy for intranasal delivery versus injection.\n\n[34:14] Gene therapy for aging, you mentioned briefly in the last slide.\n\n[34:18] What do you think is the main difference and what will be the main barrier for intranasal versus injection for gene therapy delivery?\n\n[34:26] Well, intranasal has the obvious advantage that you can do it at home.\n\n[34:33] It's not what normally people think about, but it's in principle, you could also do an injection.\n\n[34:45] Most, for example, diabetics do intramuscular injections on a daily basis of insulin, typically genetically engineered.\n\n[34:55] But I think that's the main difference.\n\n[35:01] It may be particularly appropriate for respiratory diseases, protection against lung cancer and respiratory illnesses of pathogens.\n\n[35:19] But yeah, I think they're not fundamentally different.\n\n[35:24] Is there any barrier for intranasal delivery, though?\n\n[35:28] Oh, yes. I think there's a number of things that would be challenging to do that way.\n\n[35:33] But since cells can, there are cells that can cross the lung epithelium into the blood.\n\n[35:44] And there are other cells that are capable of getting from the intestine across that difficult barrier into the blood\n\n[35:53] and going to the informal blood to the typical additional crossings like blood-brain barrier.\n\n[35:59] In principle, there are a number of interesting options.\n\n[36:04] But for the time being, I think there are things that are more appropriately delivered by, say, intrathecal injection into the cerebral spinal fluid,\n\n[36:14] for example, is a good way of getting into the brain without necessarily having an engineer cross the blood-brain barrier.\n\n[36:22] But we have plenty that do. They could preferentially even into the nervous system.\n\n[36:29] Awesome. Thank you so much.\n\n[36:32] Wonderful. Next one up, we have Agedness Partners.\n\n[36:36] Thank you. And thanks a lot, George Church, for sharing all your ideas here.\n\n[36:42] I just had a question on one of the slides where you were talking about the four-combination gene therapy.\n\n[36:49] I was just curious, sort of a multi-part question, but I'm curious, are we testing this in humans?\n\n[36:59] And if there's any sort of trade-offs between the delivery mechanisms, like having more than, you know,\n\n[37:08] can you have more than one in this combination? Like if you were doing lipid nanoparticles with an AAV,\n\n[37:15] is there any complications if you're combining multiple therapies?\n\n[37:21] And I was also curious out of that four bunch, if there was one in particular for osteoarthritis,\n\n[37:28] or if it was a synergistic thing between more than one.\n\n[37:34] Right. So we did find one indication, one disease where all three together,\n\n[37:45] so in general, all three together is a good combination.\n\n[37:49] But we found some indication for where we drop one of them out.\n\n[37:54] My guess is that at some point we will add some others in because we really want to get all ten pathways of aging at once,\n\n[38:05] because if you leave one opening, those four will kill you.\n\n[38:10] In fact, it's been estimated that if you got rid of one of them, you might add two years to your life, but we won't get rid of all of them.\n\n[38:19] So we haven't got the final list of genes yet, but those three that Noah Davidson used look particularly promising,\n\n[38:29] and including osteoarthritis.\n\n[38:33] Nice. And is it currently being tested in humans or anywhere?\n\n[38:38] We have not started human clinical trials yet. We've started FDA approved dog trials,\n\n[38:44] which is very close in many ways in size and environment and food and so forth.\n\n[38:51] But as soon as those are completed or nearly completed, we will start the human clinical trials, which could be two years from now.\n\n[39:00] Gotcha. Thanks. Appreciate it.\n\n[39:03] Wonderful. Larry, you're up next.\n\n[39:08] Hi, George. Interesting stuff. I mean, I was curious about your codon change thing.\n\n[39:15] I mean, you know, AG, I think the AG-serine codons, I think they are used in a lot of human proteins.\n\n[39:22] I didn't quite understand how it would work to actually get viral inhibition exclusively.\n\n[39:32] And then the other thing on your your your your adenosine doesn't mutate directly to the guanosine.\n\n[39:39] It goes through inosine and there is an inosine repair mechanism.\n\n[39:43] But you're saying that's deficient in cells or you think adenosine deaminates as a target for aging.\n\n[39:49] I mean, I think it's an interesting thing. I'm just not that familiar with what you want with those things.\n\n[39:56] Right. Two good questions.\n\n[39:59] And so it is true that both the human genome and the bacterial genome that we did these experiments in,\n\n[40:08] you have 20,000 examples of those codons being used in the protein sphere.\n\n[40:20] But what we did is we mutated all of those places so that they're no longer used.\n\n[40:25] We swapped them out into the synonymous codons.\n\n[40:28] There are six different ways, six different codons.\n\n[40:31] We eliminated two of them by mapping them onto the other four.\n\n[40:36] So in those cells, they're only using four of the six codons.\n\n[40:40] So that's null for a while. And then we put in a new tRNA that turns those codons from serine to null to leucine.\n\n[40:48] So we kind of go through a null and a mediate.\n\n[40:51] But yes, the host and the inhibitor anyway from phages.\n\n[40:56] I'm sorry I missed that.\n\n[41:01] Yeah, you're protecting E. coli from phages.\n\n[41:04] That is correct. Yeah, that's correct.\n\n[41:06] That so far has just been done in E. coli, but it's been done by a method that we think is completely general,\n\n[41:11] which is changing the genetic code.\n\n[41:13] And we are partway into doing it in human stem cells.\n\n[41:18] So and then and we will do plants and domesticated animals as well.\n\n[41:25] Anything that's got a serious viral problem of economic significance.\n\n[41:31] But we don't have that yet.\n\n[41:34] Anyway, so to answer your question, we did the genetic engineering.\n\n[41:37] So the host is no longer dependent on those two codons.\n\n[41:43] And your second question was about and adding is is is indeed goes through in a scene on suede guanine.\n\n[41:51] It's a simple that the repair is typically done by replication and the replication of the eye typically takes it to a G.\n\n[42:01] And if it doesn't, then you can do another round of mutagenesis for the same.\n\n[42:09] The MNase. So, but there are no pair mechanism for that to George, right?\n\n[42:15] I mean, the repair and I can see and gets in there and you know, yeah, I.\n\n[42:23] It is not nearly as efficient as the repair mechanism for cytosine.\n\n[42:29] Yeah, and in fact, yeah, it was an aging another aging clock potentially.\n\n[42:37] Then if you take a cell that hasn't replicated in a cell that that that replicates a lot.\n\n[42:43] Yeah, I don't that wasn't part of our plan.\n\n[42:49] We'll take it under advisement.\n\n[42:51] It's it's yeah, the plan was just used.\n\n[42:55] So Tennessee DMA as a as a simple way of doing editing.\n\n[42:59] It's not toxic. It is the least toxic way of doing multiplex editing we've found by far.\n\n[43:05] OK, wonderful.\n\n[43:08] Chris makes it up. We have Crian.\n\n[43:13] Thanks, Alison. Hi, George. George.\n\n[43:16] It's been a while. I have a sort of vague question that could go different ways, but it's this.\n\n[43:24] So if you have this scheme whereby you can, if I understand it correctly,\n\n[43:29] make cells resistant to viral manipulation, how do you route around that?\n\n[43:37] If you want to use viruses to manipulate cells, that's the first thing.\n\n[43:42] And then this related thing is I know another part of your world, you have,\n\n[43:49] at least in the past, done these sort of broad mass sequencing gathers in the sea and all kinds of places and presumably in in our guts, you name it.\n\n[44:02] So what I'm wondering there and this is how it relates is.\n\n[44:07] If you could say something about the genetic diversity of the microbiome that we carry around, including the virome that we carry around.\n\n[44:20] How many viruses are in us and what are they doing?\n\n[44:24] What are they doing? And if you shut off this viral stuff, as you're alluding to.\n\n[44:31] Does this have sort of broader species or ecosystem consequences like are these viruses just\n\n[44:42] working against us or is there something deeper going on? So first question simple, how do you route around?\n\n[44:49] Viral vectors, if you've turned off viral infection.\n\n[44:53] And secondly, what about the broader virome and what's going on there?\n\n[44:58] Well, first one is slightly easier.\n\n[45:01] Both of them are great questions.\n\n[45:04] The if we want to use viruses, as I mentioned, we used our delivery and three out of the top five COVID vaccines.\n\n[45:16] In that case, it's typically a synthetic.\n\n[45:20] We completely get rid of the viral nucleic acid.\n\n[45:23] We're just using the viral capsid.\n\n[45:25] We still some kind of nucleic acid makes that capsid, but it can make it in a completely different cell, a non-recoded cell.\n\n[45:35] Then the payload itself is synthetic and it can be whatever you want.\n\n[45:39] So you can use the new code and would use the new code for that.\n\n[45:43] Whether it's messenger RNA based vaccine or viral DNA based.\n\n[45:50] So that's all synthetic where we can and do handle them.\n\n[45:57] But these are not typically full viruses.\n\n[46:01] These are hybrids of viral capsid proteins on a payload, which is non-viral.\n\n[46:08] And then to the environmental components, we have found some bacteria that are helpful that are in our guts.\n\n[46:17] Not typically pathogens, just the opposite.\n\n[46:20] They're helpful bacteria.\n\n[46:22] So we would want to eliminate those.\n\n[46:24] We have not yet found a viral component.\n\n[46:27] So I'm aware of other than ironically the endogenous retroviruses that we eliminated in pigs.\n\n[46:32] But even there we showed that what we did was we knew that there one gene of the virus is helpful, which was the envelope gene.\n\n[46:39] But its ability to hop around and to cross species was not necessary.\n\n[46:44] So that the envelope gene is involved in making the extra embryonic tissue system involved in the maternal fetal communication in the placental.\n\n[46:56] So we did not eliminate that.\n\n[46:58] We've simply eliminated the polymerase genes required for this hopping around, which is probably detrimental.\n\n[47:05] We'll keep our eyes open for other viruses in the environment that might be helpful.\n\n[47:10] But I think those many of those functions, if they ever are found, could be substituted by either a repoted version of the genes or some other mechanism.\n\n[47:24] Like I said, there's none that we know of yet.\n\n[47:27] But if anybody finds one, I'm all ears.\n\n[47:33] Great.\n\n[47:34] We have a few more questions here next.\n\n[47:37] Let's see one by George, by John Ferber.\n\n[47:40] And then I will take a few like final questions.\n\n[47:44] Hi, George.\n\n[47:45] It's been a while since before the COVID pandemic.\n\n[47:50] Some types of gene therapy only require a few cells or a few types of cells to be altered.\n\n[47:57] I wanted to alter every cell in the body.\n\n[48:02] Is there a technology that would guarantee getting it into every cell, including past the blood brain barrier?\n\n[48:10] Almost.\n\n[48:13] So I left out a few slides that cover that.\n\n[48:17] We have a couple of my companies are working on targeted delivery, in particular, of dino therapeutics.\n\n[48:29] We published a Nature Biotech paper where we showed that we could engineer it and select for various tissue deliveries, including brain delivery.\n\n[48:44] But many others, we could do this simultaneously.\n\n[48:48] We design a library of millions.\n\n[48:50] This is not random, but machine learning based design.\n\n[48:55] And that million then sorts itself out in various tissues in the body.\n\n[48:59] And then we look for which ones are enriched in the different tissues.\n\n[49:03] And we have found that using machine learning, we can up the amount of change that we can tolerate from, you know,\n\n[49:11] with naive non-machine learning based methods, it's hard to get beyond four out of 28 positions.\n\n[49:19] Let's say we take the region of the genome 28 amino acids long.\n\n[49:25] We could get, if we tried to get four out of 28, we're getting, you know, low single digit percent survival.\n\n[49:33] And if we go above that, we get undetectable survival.\n\n[49:36] But now, now with machine learning, we could get up to 28 out of 28 amino acid changes, which is quite high.\n\n[49:44] Well, related to that, I'm very interested in doing something about line one, messing up the genome.\n\n[49:53] And I'm guessing that that's important in every cell in the body and that there's a lot of line ones in every cell.\n\n[50:01] And I'm wondering how we can possibly either fear with delete or somehow prevent damage by line one in most or all cells.\n\n[50:13] Right. So unlike the endogenous retroviruses, the lines are, you know, a very, very distant cousin.\n\n[50:21] There's no known positive effect of lines.\n\n[50:26] And so it looks like there's some negative effects.\n\n[50:29] And we in the same way we can knock out the endogenous retroviruses by hitting the reverse transcriptase gene.\n\n[50:36] We can hit the analogous conserved active site in line elements.\n\n[50:41] And so we're doing that now in animals to see whether they could truly survive multi generations without active line transposition or reverse transcriptase.\n\n[50:55] That's that we don't know yet. It's my guess that that will be in that positive.\n\n[51:00] But we have now the genetic tools to ask that question.\n\n[51:04] Thank you. And the final. Have you published on it?\n\n[51:10] We've published the line elements mutation in human cells. We're just starting the animal experiments.\n\n[51:19] Wonderful. Thanks. In the last five minutes, I would love to get to the questions that we always ask in the session, which are number one, for someone new entering your field.\n\n[51:30] And I mean, your field was so broad. Let's keep it perhaps on the, you know, aging longevity relevant bits of the fields, which is of most interested people in this group, if you may.\n\n[51:40] What would someone be working on if they come into the field?\n\n[51:45] Like what would make your work in that as long as in as much as relates to longevity and aging like much easier?\n\n[51:52] Like what's an undervalued challenge where you're like, hey, if you're new to this area and want to take something on and make my work much easier, this is what you do.\n\n[52:02] Yeah, I think multiplex editing where you can make a large number of edits is very valuable.\n\n[52:08] It's still challenging to say do genome recoding that which requires so much multiplex editing. I think that's a bottleneck.\n\n[52:17] You know, most groups, including most pharmaceutical companies rarely go beyond one or two genes at a time.\n\n[52:24] We're going to get into the tens of thousands. That's that's one thing I think is quite valuable.\n\n[52:31] I think that's\n\n[52:37] using\n\n[52:41] viral delivery is still not solved problem. I said that we had ways we can\n\n[52:46] really get high levels of mutagenesis and deliveries in the target, but it's still this is a far cry from\n\n[52:58] you know, getting delivered to every cell or even every stem cell in the body at 100%. Now, fortunately, you don't need that delivery, but it's something there's quite a bit of a room for food.\n\n[53:10] So multiplex editing and delivery mechanisms.\n\n[53:15] Okay, and then if we say, you know, make much progress on this, could you, you know, kind of like leave us with perhaps like a vision of like what could be possible in a, you know, case where everything goes right in longevity, you know, based on the tools and mechanisms that you're developing in like five to 10 years?\n\n[53:34] Well, I won't abuse the everything goes right card.\n\n[53:40] Try to keep it realistic as but yeah, I think it's quite possible that we could\n\n[53:48] make a low cost gene therapy, you know, dollars a dose that is once and done.\n\n[53:56] That gets a large fraction, let's say 90 plus percent of the key cells not the soil every cell and results in an rejuvenated process that is somewhat similar to what we've observed with the cocktail of young blood saccars and the and the almanac saccars.\n\n[54:19] Some set of results like the analogous to what we've seen, but in a clinical setting, applicable to almost every cell at high efficiency.\n\n[54:31] And that, and that could have them implications for diseases, not just though, but diseases of poverty, because it is effect effects on so many diseases and it was\n\n[54:48] extremely low cost.\n\n[54:52] And then other tools maybe not directly aimed at aging for further impact on diseases, infectious diseases, diseases of poverty. And that would have a positive feedback with the economic significance worldwide.\n\n[55:11] It's a nice existential vision of what's possible here. And then, you know, really finally, this is like a shameless plug moment.\n\n[55:20] You know what is there anything that people can concretely do to really advance your work so usually like if people are currently raising funds for like another startup or if you know they have like a new paper all that you know they want people to read.\n\n[55:33] And this is a moment where is there anything that this group would really appreciate their work could do to advance your individual work.\n\n[55:43] Well, I think it could be a mutual benefit.\n\n[55:47] And I, I kind of shamelessly plugged all the way through this talk I'm not sure we need a separate floor. But yeah, we're a very collaborative group and happy to work with people.\n\n[56:02] And started, you know, started companies which is the way we get it into the real world and out of the really academic by with our\n\n[56:11] to, you know, better ways of doing clinical trials that's something was\n\n[56:18] quite challenging but but but you can see progress all the time is, you know, veterinary trials go about five times faster but the COVID-19 clinical trials set a record of about one year and so the usual 10.\n\n[56:31] So I think there's a lot of potential there as well.\n\n[56:36] It certainly is. Thank you so so much. This was absolutely wonderful. And yeah, you've had a full house.\n\n[56:45] Thank you so much for joining us. It was a pleasure to have you on. I hope it wasn't the last time if you do have, you know, future updates on your work like this group is certainly pretty interesting as you can tell from attendance.\n\n[56:57] Thanks everyone for joining. Just a reminder I put a nomination form near the chat if you want to nominate future presentations. It's here in this chat. Thank you, George.\n\n[57:06] Okay, get on. Thank you. And thanks a lot. Bye everyone.\n\n[57:09] See you next one. Yeah. Bye."

        "transcription": "[00:30] Welcome to another episode of Progress, Potential, and Possibilities, discussions with fascinating\n\n[00:58] people designing a better tomorrow for all of us. I'm your host, Ira Pastor.\n\n[01:02] Welcome everybody again to another episode of our show, bringing in another really awesome guest today involved in creating a better tomorrow.\n\n[01:12] Today we have the honor of being joined by Dr. Andrea Cho, who is the chief executive officer and co-founder of Holoclara, which is a really interesting biotech company.\n\n[01:23] They're focused on creating these novel, safe, orally bioavailable worm divide therapies, ultimately with a focus on therapeutic indications like allergies and autoimmune disorders.\n\n[01:35] While she was pursuing her doctorate at California Institute of Technology, Dr. Cho was involved in uncovering this really unique science around pharma languages that, you know, shared by roundworms that have evolved over hundreds of millions of years.\n\n[01:52] And ultimately her research and her discovery led her in the direction of really interesting novel molecules derived from these worms that can block the formation of various diseases in animal models of allergies, autoimmune disorders.\n\n[02:05] And this ultimately has led not just to the formation of Holoclara, but really some really interesting advances in the fields of both evolutionary biology as well as extreme biology.\n\n[02:15] And that's that Holoclara is focused on ultimately taking this technology and the mission to develop an entirely new class of therapeutics that can provide relief for millions of patients that live with these chronic debilitating disorders.\n\n[02:27] Dr. Cho is a winner of the Emerging Women's Founders Award in Biotech.\n\n[02:32] She did her medical degree at USC Keck School of Medicine, her PhD at Caltech, and is recently, as just a couple weeks ago, coming off a very impressive $16 million series financing to move the company's initiatives forward.\n\n[02:46] We're honored to have with us a lot of exciting themes to get into today. Dr. Andrea Cho, welcome to our show.\n\n[02:54] Ira, thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here and I'm excited to chat with you.\n\n[02:59] I'm excited you're here. I really enjoy what you're doing in this topic.\n\n[03:04] I would love to start off by handing you the floor for a little bit to talk a little bit more about you.\n\n[03:11] And ultimately, I spent a lot of time reading about you.\n\n[03:15] Clearly, you were doing the medical degree and the PhD at the same time.\n\n[03:19] I would love to hear about how you sort of migrated from, well, obviously, human work to, I know you work with mice to flies and ultimately how you ended up in Dr. Sternberg's lab working with nematodes.\n\n[03:30] I think that'd be a great way to start things off.\n\n[03:34] Yeah, I would love to tell you about, I'm trying to figure out where the best place to start in the story because you're right, there was this MD PhD component.\n\n[03:44] And it is split up in an interesting way when you do your MD PhD in the US, you do your first two years of medicine, which is a lot of in classroom learning.\n\n[03:55] That's where it's a lot of books. And that's where I became a hypochondriac.\n\n[04:00] You know, you're just reading about what are these diseases and do I have them? And then you do your PhD.\n\n[04:07] And then you go back and you do your two clinical years where it's solely looking at patients.\n\n[04:12] So that was a really interesting split for me because I gained a lot of insight into human health and these diseases that we're suffering from and then went straight into my PhD.\n\n[04:26] And at the time that I went to Caltech, I was naturally kind of looking at labs that might be studying human disease.\n\n[04:36] And then simultaneously, we had just finished human genome project and people were asking all these questions like, well, now we have this list of really interesting genes.\n\n[04:45] How do we study them?\n\n[04:47] Enter the roundworm. That's where C. elegans, this round, really simple roundworm crossed my path.\n\n[04:57] And I thought it was so interesting that you could study so many genes in this roundworm.\n\n[05:04] You could take a gene out. You could take a knock in a gene. You could do anything in any part of the life of this worm.\n\n[05:13] Like you could take a worm that's, you know, a partial juvenile versus an adult versus an egg and knock out a gene at that time and see what happens.\n\n[05:22] So I was just really fascinated with that. And like you said, I had done a rotation in flies.\n\n[05:29] I'd also worked with mice and just the simpler things got, the more I felt like we could explore something really deep and interesting about life.\n\n[05:40] So that's what brought me to the worms.\n\n[05:44] I'll just stop there for a second because I know that that was already kind of a lot to take in.\n\n[05:50] No, no, no. It's spot on. And obviously it leads up to my sort of my next talking point because, you know, we have this class, you know, that is sort of of the nematodes.\n\n[06:04] I've seen some of the figures here. So I know there's some debate on whether there's like 10,000 different species or potentially I have seen figures of upwards of a million.\n\n[06:14] They have adapted very successfully to every ecosystem, even those that put them in the category of extremophile.\n\n[06:22] The coolest number I saw is this 500 quintillion.\n\n[06:26] There's quite a few of them on the planet. And with 500 million years of evolution behind them, they're really good at producing chemistry, communicating with chemistry, defending with chemistry.\n\n[06:39] And we got no one's really ever tapped into that. So I think that's an extremely exciting thing that you're doing.\n\n[06:44] Before we get to the company, though, I'd love to stop at your your PhD. You published in 2012 pheromones and free living and parasitic nematodes.\n\n[06:53] And, you know, you go into, you know, you learn about, you know, you talk about this really interesting class of small molecules, the ascarasides, which we getting into the fact that these compounds can do many things in terms of attraction or delaying growth in an enemy.\n\n[07:08] And then some other interesting similarities of the chemistry's in terms of bacteria quorum sensing, which we'll talk about a little later in the show.\n\n[07:17] Talk a little bit about your dissertation. I mean, it's just a little body of cool work that I'd love to just have you reminisce on because it was, you know, 12 years ago.\n\n[07:26] Yeah, thank you so much for actually reading that and being interested in that. I guess where I would love to, you know, actually, so I was thinking about it. My husband is a musician.\n\n[07:39] I would Ferguson. I've been listening to his music for about a decade. And the other day, he told me something. One of his central themes is, you know, he likes to explore ways to reveal the unseen.\n\n[07:54] And he said that that's been his theme, his theme for a while now. I thought, well, that's so interesting because as scientists, that's really what we're trying to do to we're trying to reveal the unseen.\n\n[08:04] Our goal is to try to reveal something about us or the universe that we just didn't know before. And so, you know, when you're looking down at a worm on an agar plate, you know, we actually had this week.\n\n[08:18] You can track anything about this worm, whether it's going left or right or decides to go to sleep. We actually had this robot on the microscope that would follow it so that when you went home at night, it would continue.\n\n[08:33] The light would stay on and it would continue to track it. You would create mathematical algorithms for every single decision a worm has made, perhaps even over its entire lifetime.\n\n[08:42] But whether it goes left or right or whether it decides to do one thing or another was always kind of a mystery. What are those things that are driving those decisions?\n\n[08:53] That's what was really interesting to me. That sort of and then at the same time, you know, I was a kid, you go to these aquariums, you see the sardine, you know, the Monterey Bay Aquarium.\n\n[09:04] You see that sardine tank where they're all going in one direction or you see starlings in the sky and they're all going in one direction. How are they navigating those things?\n\n[09:14] What are those unseen forces? What are the unseen molecules that are guiding that sort of behavior as a group? So that was another piece that was really interesting to me.\n\n[09:25] And when you're looking down in your hand and you're holding this agri plate with the worm, that now you have a whole algorithm that you've just gathered about its entire life decisions.\n\n[09:36] I remember looking up from the microscope and someone had printed out this phylogenetic treat and cut it out and taped it on the wall. It might actually still be there.\n\n[09:47] I once was walking down the hall with Caltech and I saw in a freezer like a 20 faded paper that said human genome freezer project freezer.\n\n[09:56] I was like, you know how long that's been there? So looking at this tree, it was really interesting because I saw the worm that was in my hand.\n\n[10:05] It had been first evolved 500,000 years ago. I was like, wow, that is really interesting. Wait, how is that possible? I'm holding this worm in my hand.\n\n[10:14] It evolved half a million years ago. And then when it was discovered some early on, like a couple of decades ago, someone made this great decision to freeze as many as possible of this strain of this generation and then chip away at it and send it to any scientists around the world so that they can study this generation of worm and have a mutual understanding about that.\n\n[10:40] Now, you know, you've seen there's all these Nobel prizes that have been awarded to C. elegans researchers.\n\n[10:45] So then that really was interesting to me to look at this tree and say, okay, wow, there's a whole field of scientists that are studying this one worm, but there's all these lines before and after it, but he evolved 600,000 years ago or sooner than that.\n\n[11:04] And the natural question became, well, where are those worms? Where are they? I want to see them. How are they different? And so I took on this project where I would find them and I would sort of study how are they moving differently? What's different about them?\n\n[11:22] And I took on this project ultimately of pheromones because they were attracting the worms. They were making, they were guiding them to either go into diapause or this diapausal life stage where they can go into hibernation, live for a long time, or meet, find, or choose not to.\n\n[11:41] And then I realized, oh, they're actually secreting things. Now we can get all of these different worms that had evolved hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n[11:51] And how amazing is it that there are scientists around the world that have frozen them and are willing to send them to me and I can revive them. Actually, they come in the mail.\n\n[12:01] Well, they send them to you in a mail and you rip open your little package and there's a little agar, like maybe a five centimeter agar plate that's been taped around so no worms can escape.\n\n[12:11] You open it up and they're already moving around and you just take, take that awesome present. You go to the microscope and you see how different they are. You start collecting their pheromones.\n\n[12:22] You start asking, how is it, how can, if I divide this pheromone into a couple of fractions, what is it going to do to this worm? So that's sort of what led into this interest of, of pheromones.\n\n[12:36] So from there, the interesting discovery was no matter how far I went on this evolutionary tree, we found this class of molecules that had been conserved, meaning that they were all secreting a similar language.\n\n[12:50] So that's where things get really interesting because I thought, wait, how is that possible? You know, in insects, you really try to avoid using the same pheromones because you don't want to get confused and mate with the same pheromones.\n\n[13:02] I don't know, moth, if you're one moth, but the worms were you secreting a lot of the same language and they had this unique sugar moiety not made by any other animal in the world and different links of the carbon tail were like different letters of the alphabet.\n\n[13:15] Different combinations would make them the different things. I mean, that's to any scientist, such an interesting thing to study is trying to decode the different things that you can see in the same pheromones.\n\n[13:29] Such an interesting thing to study is trying to decode this language that's been here under our nose this whole time for millions of years.\n\n[13:42] And I thought that was really interesting. Actually, it just, I have been saying hundreds of thousands of years. I actually meant hundreds of millions of years. So C. elegans was actually evolved a couple hundred million years ago.\n\n[13:53] And it's funny I made that mistake because it's so hard to think about something that was that long ago. Like it kind of, I still can't think about what life could be like before the Egyptians, right?\n\n[14:05] It's quite intriguing whether we talk about worms or plants or any of these organs. Been here a long time, survived many extinctions. A lot of stuff has gone bye bye and they're still hanging out.\n\n[14:25] And yeah, I mean, they do it with chemistry and really good at evolving and figuring out what works, what doesn't, finding out interesting combinations. So no, it's extremely exciting.\n\n[14:37] And then, you know, just as a, you know, after your PhD, because, you know, we're talking about, you know, obviously this, this evolutionary perfected toolkit that whether it's C. elegans or some of these other ones that you published about Panagrellus redivivus.\n\n[14:54] There's all sorts of cool names, but these chemicals you've not just published on the interaction between the different nematodes, but you followed up with a variety of really interesting papers.\n\n[15:07] There's one on nematode signaling in the metabolism of animals, plants and microorganisms. Another cool one on the way they elicit all sorts of interesting plant defense and pathogen resistance.\n\n[15:18] Talk about the cross species component here because clearly the species will be getting up to humans. You know, is what we're most interested in.\n\n[15:27] And then in addition to how the nematodes play their chemical game with plants and everything else out there, you also talk a little bit about in your publications, the hygiene issue.\n\n[15:38] And we talked a little bit about this before on the show that, hey, we used to we've been co evolving with them as you know, we haven't been there that long, but nonetheless, you know, we've done a lot to kill off and get a lot of these things out of our ecosystem.\n\n[15:53] Maybe that hasn't been the greatest thing because tremendous uptick in allergies and autoimmune disease following these technologies. Say a few words about the hygiene hypothesis connection here as well, if you would.\n\n[16:04] Yeah, I mean, I think to go.\n\n[16:07] Well, I have to confess then in telling this whole story that when I picked my PhD, I really took on this pheromonal language. I truly just wore the hat of evolutionary biologist.\n\n[16:20] And I don't know if my my MD PhD program at the time knew that I just took on this really evolutionary project. And that's that's honestly because I have an interest in both human health and also just life and the world and Earth.\n\n[16:35] So then I didn't know that at that time that there could be this cross species and therapeutic potential that I heard this radio lab podcast where some guy with terrible asthma, nothing worked for him.\n\n[16:50] He walked. He went to Africa to walk barefoot to get hookworms on purpose to treat his disease. And it works for him. And he came back and he tried to sell it.\n\n[16:59] So that was very interesting to me because I thought, what? What is why would he do that? And what is going on? And that's when I started realizing that the hygiene hypothesis expanded into worms and that they're not just the case of this really interesting individual.\n\n[17:17] But as I was diving into the literature, I saw that there were all of these findings where even people that with Crohn's disease that took worms would go into remission.\n\n[17:31] And then there were all these decades of preclinical studies in animal models of diseases showing that when they returned got hookworms that the disease would be eradicated or blocked.\n\n[17:44] And so I thought that was really interesting. So I started with that and I started exploring why is that.\n\n[17:51] And so there's this whole study where we actually if you look at mummies that they have had got roundworms from a very long time ago, the oldest mummy that you could find, odds eat a Iceman.\n\n[18:04] Remember when they found him? King Richard the third when they found his body under the parking lot. There was there was worms.\n\n[18:12] So I think that there has been a long history of worms. And the further you go into the literature, you realize, oh, they've actually been here before we were homo sapiens.\n\n[18:22] They were here back when we were in the grasslands like Lucy and australopithecus, and they've co evolved with all of our human ancestors to this point.\n\n[18:33] So now it makes sense that actually they're a part of our immune system the same way that gut bacteria are a part of our immune system.\n\n[18:40] And they're communicating with all of the molecules, the pheromones of our body.\n\n[18:47] And when we take them out, what happens? Well, we know what happens.\n\n[18:52] And then suddenly there's a spike in allergic and autoimmune disease. Is that a coincidence?\n\n[19:04] And epidemiologically, you know, sure, you can always ask yourself if that's a question.\n\n[19:09] But if you look up, you know, if you go to chat, GPT right now and you ask what's the country with the most allergic and autoimmune disease?\n\n[19:16] It's sub-Saharan Africa. And what's the country that has the least, I'm sorry, the least amount of allergic and autoimmune disease that's sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n[19:26] What is the country that has the most amount of gut dwelling brown worms? Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n[19:34] So that's really interesting because they didn't take out their worms. They're also not industrialized.\n\n[19:41] They're not they don't have a bunch of microplastics in all of their food and all of these components.\n\n[19:48] So then I thought, let's get into the worm piece there. Let's tie this now.\n\n[19:53] Now people are looking for what could it be that these worms are secreting that could be responsible for protecting them?\n\n[20:01] And then that's where I thought, oh, I think I have that right. I've tapped into this secret language of worms.\n\n[20:07] Could it be that something from there is capable of doing that? And lo and behold, that's what we found.\n\n[20:13] So then that's what changed my trajectory in becoming a physician scientist, which was just my plan for the longest time.\n\n[20:24] And when you suffer through that many standardized tests, you're like, I'm doing it no matter what.\n\n[20:31] So it really wasn't my plan initially to be an entrepreneur. It's not a necessity because I knew that there was a lot of potential here in the discovery that we made that we could actually turn the tides on allergic and autoimmune disease.\n\n[20:47] No one had actually tested this before. We've been trying putting back bacteria for decades now, right? It hasn't turned the tides yet.\n\n[20:55] Could it be that the missing piece is actually worms? And can we return that without having to return gut roundworms?\n\n[21:04] Can we encapsulate some of the key therapeutic secretions that they're utilizing and then return that back into mankind? What would happen?\n\n[21:16] And so I just really need to know the answer to that.\n\n[21:21] And, you know, I mean, you might have wanted to be an entrepreneur, but you turned out to be a pretty good one.\n\n[21:26] And so, I mean, you know, it leads us up to Hola Clara.\n\n[21:31] We'd love to hear a little bit. Well, I love to hear where the name comes from.\n\n[21:35] But, you know, clearly you've been on a roll.\n\n[21:39] There's, you know, you've been publishing on a lot of the sort of the the pharmacology as of late.\n\n[21:48] It was an interesting paper that you did in PNAS on mammalian type two inflammatory responses, interesting models of asthma,\n\n[21:59] even patented on all sorts of interesting mechanisms of these substances.\n\n[22:05] I'll six, I'll one disease, the oceanophilic esophagitis.\n\n[22:10] Talk about the company, sort of what goes on on any day.\n\n[22:14] And what do you have? I have a lot of worms and assays.\n\n[22:18] But what typically happens in your discovery process?\n\n[22:22] And, you know, how do you choose which of these interesting diseases to go after?\n\n[22:27] Walk us through a little bit of sort of the day to day of Hola Clara, if you would.\n\n[22:31] Yeah, I think in making those sorts of decisions about where we go, which molecules we choose,\n\n[22:38] we've really pulled in a lot of great advisors and people that are here to help with that process.\n\n[22:47] So, you know, early on, I thought, OK, how first of all, how are we going to do this?\n\n[22:52] Are we going to put this into a powder and sell it at GNC?\n\n[22:57] Or are we going to formulate this into a drug and go to the FDA?\n\n[23:02] And that's for anyone that's an academic. That's a little daunting.\n\n[23:07] Right. Because you just think, oh, hundreds of millions of dollars, huge failure rate.\n\n[23:13] But when I did the analysis, here's what I came to that really drove that decision, which is I impact.\n\n[23:21] I think this could truly change the world. What is the greatest impact?\n\n[23:25] And that really is FDA approval on clinical trial.\n\n[23:30] The other reason is of not going into a supplement or medical food, which I've explored all of those,\n\n[23:36] is that I read this study that if someone changes your copayment by even a couple of bucks,\n\n[23:44] people don't want to take that medicine, even if it leads to morbidity, mortality,\n\n[23:51] because there's something about when you when you start paying two dollars fifty cents for your medication, you get used to that.\n\n[23:58] You really get used to that. And I get it.\n\n[24:01] People can't afford expensive medication.\n\n[24:04] So if I'm trying to sell my supplement for 100, 200 dollars out of pocket, then my reach is going to be pretty limited.\n\n[24:14] So that's how I thought about, OK, we're going to do FDA approved trots.\n\n[24:21] So that's number one. Number two is the molecule.\n\n[24:24] And we chose a potent molecule that not only worked for allergic disease, which is TH2, but also autoimmune disease,\n\n[24:36] which is TH1, T helper type two and T helper type one.\n\n[24:40] And so that was really interesting because then we realized this is not working like your typical drug.\n\n[24:47] Nowadays, we look in drug as modern day drug developers.\n\n[24:52] Look at the history of how we've been doing it.\n\n[24:54] You know, we started with nature to try to find things like that could just naturally affect, you know,\n\n[25:01] help people with with antibiotics or natural chemo drugs.\n\n[25:07] And then we moved into this era of targeting things to take them down.\n\n[25:11] Like a biologic is a targeted monoclonal antibody that will take something down.\n\n[25:15] And so we get used to this mentality of let's inhibit, let's block, let's take the disease pathways and block them.\n\n[25:21] So now we have a technology that's in different contexts of disease able to block either a allergic disease or not immune disease.\n\n[25:30] So what that means is it's actually not blocking anything.\n\n[25:34] It's promoting something. It's promoting the good cells of the immune system.\n\n[25:40] It's promoting the regulatory elements that are now able to block disease.\n\n[25:46] And I thought that was really incredible because of course, nature evolves something to work with the immune system, not against it.\n\n[25:55] And then how can we continue to understand that? That's really compelling to me.\n\n[26:00] So for our first molecule, we're starting with an allergic disease.\n\n[26:05] The plan for it to quickly follow on to the autoimmune space as well.\n\n[26:11] And I can share more about that indication later this year.\n\n[26:15] We are entering clinical or phase one clinical trial this year.\n\n[26:19] And so that is with healthy volunteers where we'll be able to get pharmacokinetic data in humans that will be orally ingesting this molecule and returning it back to mankind for the first time, which actually is where the name Holoclara comes from.\n\n[26:35] Holoclara comes from the Greek word holoclaros, which means to complete the missing piece, to complete.\n\n[26:41] And I think that this is actually the one thing that we've been missing and we haven't yet returned.\n\n[26:47] So this will be the first time in the history of mankind that we're going to replace and return this missing piece now that it had been removed.\n\n[27:00] Andre, you mentioned early on, you know, you're talking a little bit about sort of the novel structures that you were finding in the pheromones when you're doing this work.\n\n[27:13] And, you know, for my own a couple of careers ago, I was involved in the in the in the fight of chemistry space.\n\n[27:20] And I was always amazed by the the complexity of which plants and these other organisms created their chemistry.\n\n[27:28] It was it went beyond how sort of the chemist in the lab thinks about stuff.\n\n[27:32] And I was just wondering if we're getting into confidential stuff, we can we can go right by it.\n\n[27:36] But how complex are some of these moieties that the nematodes make?\n\n[27:42] Because you mentioned sugars and fatty acid chains and stuff.\n\n[27:45] And do you have to do much in terms of modifying them?\n\n[27:50] Not just not for activity, but in the sense that sometimes it's hard to get patents around things that pop out in nature.\n\n[27:59] Yeah, so that's actually was one of my initial worries was what are we going to do with this natural molecule?\n\n[28:07] And so then I went to this chemist at Caltech, Brian Stoltz, who's well known for one of the best chemists in the world,\n\n[28:15] but also really interested in synthetic pathways from nature.\n\n[28:19] And I said, will you help me modify this molecule if we need to?\n\n[28:25] But I really don't want to change it because I don't want to change nature.\n\n[28:30] If there's something that's going to keep me up at night, it's that nature has spent millions of years innovating this great molecule and I just muck it up somehow.\n\n[28:40] And, you know, he was a great thought partner in thinking about how we could be really intentional about ways that we could modify it if need be.\n\n[28:50] Well, gee, you're trying to return this molecule, but now you're going to swallow it instead of it being secreted by a worm that's living in your gut.\n\n[28:58] So how can we help that process? How can we improve that and only modify things there?\n\n[29:04] So ultimately, we ended up doing a lot of medicinal chemistry and we did find things that worked well.\n\n[29:11] And our top modified compound, funny enough, we were going to go forward with that one.\n\n[29:18] And it ended up turning right back into the natural molecule, which I thought was so spectacular that we thought that we could iterate and make it better.\n\n[29:27] And then in the end, it was just going back to the nature's nature's active molecule.\n\n[29:34] So in that sense, there are actually a lot of ways to protect that natural molecule.\n\n[29:40] And there's formulation patents, there's method of use, and the method of use can be quite broad.\n\n[29:46] It doesn't need to be in by indication. It could be methods of modifying a whole categories of disease.\n\n[29:53] So we were very excited to move forward with our natural molecule.\n\n[29:58] Continuing along that, one of the one area that worms were not your worms, but another worm, namely the leech has had success in has been this\n\n[30:19] Herodin combos. It was, you know, this is back in whatever 20 years ago now, but, you know, they found this anticoagulant and the saliva of leeches.\n\n[30:28] It was turned into a drug. But back in the day when they were doing that research, you know, the leech, as most of these ancient organisms, didn't just secrete that one thing.\n\n[30:39] They secreted really these complex combinatorial libraries of stuff to do their leeching or whatever they needed to do.\n\n[30:47] Hey, I'm going to fight. I want to suck this blood. I don't want it to coagulate.\n\n[30:51] I'm going to pop out all sorts of anticoagulants to make sure that doesn't happen.\n\n[30:56] Single molecules developed, but obviously a lot more stuff there. And I'm just I was quite interested.\n\n[31:01] I looked at one of your patent publications and then, you know, I see much recent one utility of nematodes, small molecules.\n\n[31:08] You do mention not just compounds, but mixtures of compounds. And I know this is early in the process, but any interesting findings along the way as you're doing your work on how some of these synergies that may pop up in the sense that evolution probably says,\n\n[31:25] I'm not just going to make this one thing because of whatever I'm going to make combinations because it's probably a more efficient way of if one molecule doesn't work, this one might and so forth.\n\n[31:36] Any interesting stories, anecdotes as you're studying these compounds? Hey, you know, if we put A, B and F together, well, that's even it does something to pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics.\n\n[31:49] You see where I'm going. I'm just I do. And that's actually where I started. But we ended up finding individual molecules are actually quite potent on their own.\n\n[32:01] You know, when you're imagine you're an alchemist and you have every, you know, this lab alchemy, right? Imagine you have this great alchemy lab with all these things bubbling over when you're studying them.\n\n[32:12] The best place to start is to really characterize one thing at a time and then add a different spice.\n\n[32:19] Once you add that spice, you can't add that spice. So I think we really tried to focus on which of these molecules actually is strong on its own.\n\n[32:30] And we can always go back and study these other things that work in combination. But for our first shot over the bow, going into a trial, we don't want to make this complicated.\n\n[32:40] We want to make this as simple as possible and then go from there.\n\n[32:46] Makes complete sense. And I appreciate that. And I think I know what you're going to say. The next question I was going to ask anyway.\n\n[32:54] Back in the early 2000s, both leeches and maggots were approved in the United States by FDA as medical devices, living medical devices.\n\n[33:05] I don't know if the FDA has yet approved any living nematode products in the United States. I think there's some in Israel or some other countries.\n\n[33:13] Again, early days, you're focusing on small molecule drug development. If you came up with a really cool nematode that did something, if you kept it alive,\n\n[33:24] any interesting discussions going on in-house about FDA is open to these other types of therapies?\n\n[33:32] You can be a drug company, you can be a consumer product company, you can be a medical device company.\n\n[33:38] Hold on, hold on, hold on. Let's talk about leeches for a second because this is the second time you've brought it up.\n\n[33:43] I trained at County Hospital and it's great because you see everything and there's no treatment that's off the table.\n\n[33:52] I remember writing a script for leeches from the general pharmacy and I just could not believe when they arrived in a little saline bottle and they were looking around,\n\n[34:05] what in the world? Are we really going to do this? And there was a girl that came in with diabetic foot and there was some necrosis.\n\n[34:13] As you know, when you have necrosis, the treatment can't really, when you take it orally, it can't really reach there because it's not vascularized in that tissue as well.\n\n[34:21] So the leeches were great in that you could put them topically on and it could de-bride, it could remove some of that tissue.\n\n[34:28] So that's if you're, you just have to pretend, always ask yourself, if I am the worm, what am I doing? With a leech, that's its perspective.\n\n[34:38] And so if I were to tap the leech for more therapeutics, it would probably be, you know, like you said, okay, if it wants to take some of the tissue,\n\n[34:49] it's probably releasing something that can help numb the tissue. So then I would mine that worm for numbing agents.\n\n[34:56] Not all worms make all therapeutic things. You just have to look at it from the point of view like, if I were this worm, what would help me?\n\n[35:03] What would be beneficial for me to secrete? So then going to gut worms, that's where I'm really interested in because those are the ones that have co-evolved with the ancestors.\n\n[35:16] What is their end game? It's to promote the best environment for their host, which is their home, right?\n\n[35:23] So you want to influence things that are not just inflammation. When you're inflamed, you know, your body is sending angry, patrolling molecules.\n\n[35:31] It's the worm doesn't want any, they don't want the police force breathing down their neck, right? So they're just trying to create a balanced, happy home.\n\n[35:39] And if there's a wound, it's trying to send reparative molecules to help promote repair. You don't want a hole in your home.\n\n[35:46] So that's really where our focus is, those families of worms. And so with them, I don't want to return the actual living worm back into the human body. Why?\n\n[35:59] Because of variability. And there's always, it's so funny, someone once asked me like, what kind of, what do you, what do you have nightmares about?\n\n[36:09] And sometimes I'm like, just math, like just signal the noise. And I think that's really where this variability nightmare is.\n\n[36:18] When you give a living worm to somebody, I think you swallow it. You don't know what's going to happen to that worm.\n\n[36:25] It's it's first of all, definitely not studying the worms that go to your eyeball and all of that.\n\n[36:30] Those those ones are off the table. We're not, we're not even messing with those. I'm talking about the ones that have led to better health of those worms.\n\n[36:40] I don't want to be, I can't, I can't account for that worm. I'm not going to sit down and have a talk with it. All right.\n\n[36:46] You go into the intestine, you stay there, you have exactly 100 progeny and then you're out. Okay.\n\n[36:51] There's no way to do that. So I think that we really want to focus on removing the worm and finding ways of just taking a therapeutic and be making it measurable, understanding the pharmacokinetics of that.\n\n[37:05] And so that's why I'm moving away from live worm administration. And that's not to disparage that there are people that do that.\n\n[37:15] There are people find me and talk to me about how they give their children with intractable diseases living around worms. And now they can they can thrive and they could do things they could never do before.\n\n[37:28] So I'm not, I certainly don't disparage all those brave people and parents that are doing that.\n\n[37:35] I just thought I'd get your perspective on it because, you know, and I was thinking as much about sorry, as leashes and maggots, but, you know, with with with fage therapy as well, when you think about giving viruses and stuff like that.\n\n[37:48] But no, I appreciate your insight on that. So I just thought I'd ask because you're at the epicenter of it all. So I.\n\n[37:54] But I know as you know, bringing up fage for a minute here, I'm getting into my next topic and I think this is kind of important.\n\n[38:04] Kind of important because you do have an interesting patent on in terms of these compounds and modification of the mammalian microbiota.\n\n[38:14] Going back to your PhD for a minute, there is this cool part where you talk about the similarities between these caricides and some of the compounds that we see in bacterial quorum sensing.\n\n[38:27] And, you know, antimicrobial resistance has been a really hot topic for the show.\n\n[38:33] And, you know, obviously we're in this realm where, hey, we're yes, we need to antibiotics for the same time.\n\n[38:39] It'd be cool to have other compounds that do other things like quorum sensing say, you know, bacteria, you know, go away, separate, do other, you know, go pay attention to other stuff as opposed to sort of the typical antibiotic strategy.\n\n[38:51] Any interesting stuff that you could talk about in terms of how some of these molecules, no doubt, you know, worms have had to develop their own antibiotics over the years as well to defend against disease.\n\n[39:04] But when I saw this, you know, patent of here, I was like, they're thinking about this as well.\n\n[39:09] So it's I yes, I love this question.\n\n[39:13] And there's something that you said that stuck with me, which is go away.\n\n[39:17] And I think that that's here's what I would love to propose to you and your listeners is to try to think about possible therapeutics in a different way where we don't have to tell something to go away or inhibit or block.\n\n[39:34] How can we work with them in synergistic ways?\n\n[39:37] And I know that sounds bizarre because you're like, oh, there's a bad bacteria.\n\n[39:41] They should be out.\n\n[39:42] Well, not all bacteria are bad. It's just when they're out of control.\n\n[39:47] So how are they communicating?\n\n[39:50] And for example, you know, if you if you take an if you take an antibiotic, your wife, you're wiping out a lot of your bacteria, then suddenly you're more prone to a fungal infection.\n\n[40:00] So wiping out one thing can cause all of these.\n\n[40:03] It's about balance, not having that balance can cause a different infection to come.\n\n[40:08] So then we're playing this constant game of wipe it out.\n\n[40:10] Now deal with the side effect.\n\n[40:11] Why fund this out?\n\n[40:12] Now deal with the side effect of that.\n\n[40:14] And we're just chasing our tails as humans because that's how we're programmed to think is you take something and you take it out.\n\n[40:23] But how can we start to study now the language of all of these microbes and how we communicate with them to and our cells are communicating?\n\n[40:32] How are they working together?\n\n[40:33] And how can we promote that?\n\n[40:35] Even in that example where I said I don't the worms don't want the police force coming.\n\n[40:39] It's not that they're going to I'm just imagining a cartoon in my head of like immune immune cells dressed up like bad or something.\n\n[40:48] And you're like catching the net and you you throw them down the drain.\n\n[40:52] But actually, it's like, how do you talk to that cell and promote it to do something better with its time and its life?\n\n[41:01] And again, I know that that sounds far from our current reality of understanding, but those are the types of therapeutics that I'm really compelled by.\n\n[41:10] And I think those are the types of things that we seek to explore.\n\n[41:13] Ultimately, is this Atlas of worm molecules and how they're commuting with with the microbes and with immune cells.\n\n[41:21] And what are the molecules that they're using that can promote synergy?\n\n[41:28] I in researching this stuff to prepare for our discussion, one of the things that I found quite interesting was that the nematode taxonomy or the taxonomic clade or whatever that they're involved in.\n\n[41:46] The tardigrades are there also.\n\n[41:49] And I did a show on tardigrades a couple of years ago, which are also an extremely resilient group of organisms.\n\n[41:58] And they have this really interesting ability to shut down and go into this extended state of suspended animation.\n\n[42:10] And I saw this little piece on how these ascaricides and you mentioned this earlier on this induction of long lived sort of the stress resistant dour state.\n\n[42:22] Obviously, aging is a very hot topic as well nowadays.\n\n[42:26] Longevity biotechnology is something we focused on.\n\n[42:30] Any interesting findings so far in terms of how or thoughts on how ascaricides or other interesting molecules from these organisms can potentially be applicable in the human resilience space that sort of compromises sort of longevity biotech today.\n\n[42:48] Yeah, I love that you chose the water bear the tardigrade because it is an extreme organism and those are the types of organisms that are being studied studied in extreme biology.\n\n[43:00] How are they doing that?\n\n[43:02] Someone outer space.\n\n[43:05] And also worms they sent them down our space.\n\n[43:08] I don't know if that's part of studying whether their extreme is can you make it there and back.\n\n[43:14] The space station.\n\n[43:16] Exactly.\n\n[43:17] And I think that you just have to think about it from the perspective of that, that that organism.\n\n[43:26] So the in the example where you're talking about the worm going into hibernation state.\n\n[43:33] That's the worm itself going into hibernation state. Right. So those molecules are going to do diddly squat for the organisms around them, because it's using it for its own.\n\n[43:44] So, you know, just thinking about them turning into like Han Solo going into carbonite, you know, whatever they're they're helping themselves.\n\n[43:52] But what are the molecules where are the worms that really want to promote human health and longevity, where what what worms are those so then you're looking at hosts that have lived for a long time, or the worms that are there.\n\n[44:06] And actually, there are studies to show that they can increase stem cells and do that sort.\n\n[44:13] So I think that's where we start looking is what are the molecules from those worms that can increase stem cells and turn on these genes.\n\n[44:23] These that are so they're known as fetal genes, right, that's like, oh, wait a minute. They're able to turn those on me didn't. We haven't turned those on since you're a fetus.\n\n[44:32] How can we read how do we turn those back on. So people are finding that worms and specific worm species and think and and families of worms can do that.\n\n[44:43] So that's something that we are studying that I think is really interesting.\n\n[44:48] For sure. Yeah. Yeah, I saw that as well and thinking, you know, as we're in this really interesting era of cellular reprogramming, epigenetic rejuvenation things of that nature.\n\n[45:00] I think there's, there's a lot for you to uncover that space as well. I'm excited for you.\n\n[45:05] So that as well.\n\n[45:07] Epigenetics itself like what is that? That's the hand. That's the unseen hand, right? That's the unseen.\n\n[45:14] So I love people that are studying epigenetics because it's like the the DNA is like the the code.\n\n[45:22] The RNA is like the music and the epigenetics is like the conductor's hand. That's that's unseen.\n\n[45:28] And I think that the world right now is they're either really excited about it or really scared of what that looks like.\n\n[45:34] I think it's a really exciting time for epigenetics.\n\n[45:39] So, Andre, so I mean, awesome scientific story. You put together a great team, a really cool board.\n\n[45:47] And then, yeah, a couple of weeks ago, 16 million dollars, Series A.\n\n[45:52] What else is what else is happening that we should know about? Clearly, you're set up to do some amazing work headed towards the clinic.\n\n[45:59] What else should we know about for 2024 as we get into 2025 with regard to Huluklera?\n\n[46:06] I think it's really all about going towards the patients, right? That's our mission is ultimately to help people.\n\n[46:13] I mean, that's what your three and four med school showed me is the tremendous need of people that are looking for something outside of steroids will shut everything down or biologics will take something down.\n\n[46:25] But it's like, how can we what are the other options? So, I mean, that is always going to be a carrot at the end of my stick.\n\n[46:33] So the fact that we're going into this phase one trial is just really exciting for us at the company.\n\n[46:41] Really excited for me. Really exciting time for all of our co-founders and advisors, all the great people that are part of the Worm mission, so to speak.\n\n[46:52] All eyes are on this launch. And I think that's really where our eyes are on going into the end of this year.\n\n[47:02] And we'll be really excited to announce that more details around that and more details around the first indication that we've had our eye on that we've been really exploring, getting to understand the KOLs in the space, the patients I've been interacting with for years in that space.\n\n[47:20] So I think that that's all where my focus is going to be going into this year.\n\n[47:27] Well, it's a great focus. I'm excited for you. I'm excited for the company. I love these stories that merge, you know, hundreds of billions of years of evolutionary power with modern biopharmaceutical technology.\n\n[47:42] And I think you're on the right path. I think, you know, not to put down any of the artificial intelligence and all the other tools that we profile on the show, but nature, you know, the species have been here for a long time and still have a lot to teach us.\n\n[47:55] So I'm really looking forward to continue to follow you or your journey, the company's journey and really wishing you the best with all of it as you get close to humans.\n\n[48:04] Again, for everybody that is going to be listening to this episode of our show across the various podcast networks or who will be watching on our YouTube channel.\n\n[48:18] Again, you've been spending time with Dr. Andrea Cho, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of Holoclara, doing really amazing things to develop novel, safe, orally bioavailable, worm-derived therapeutics for a range of unmet mental conditions.\n\n[48:32] Andrea, I really want to thank you for the talk, the discussion. I really enjoyed everything. I appreciate you taking the time out of your schedule to educate us on all these topics.\n\n[48:42] And again, we'd like to say on our show, thanks for creating a better tomorrow for a lot of people via what you're going to be creating here. Really great story.\n\n[48:50] Thank you so much for having me and having this platform where you really help to support all of these ideas for a better tomorrow possibility.\n\n[48:59] I've been listening to your podcast for years. So, you know, thank you for just doing all of this and bringing these stories out there.\n\n[49:08] I appreciate the kind words. It was really a lesson having."

        "transcription": "[00:00] So I'm gonna do something different. I'm not going to show you any data in this seven minute presentation\n\n[00:06] But for the workshop session, I'll be asking you what data you would need to see in the next seven years\n\n[00:12] For us to give you a gene therapy with 13 different genes in one go\n\n[00:18] So this is an initiative we like to see as a research organization\n\n[00:23] tackling one of the core nodes of aging\n\n[00:26] And it starts right here at your DNA headquarters\n\n[00:29] This is what we usually refer to when we talk about human DNA genes the human genome\n\n[00:35] DNA headquarters what most people don't realize is that we have a second genome in each of our cells\n\n[00:40] It controls what we refer to as the power plant our mitochondria. It's a mitochondrial DNA\n\n[00:45] It's about 400,000 times smaller than the nuclear DNA, but it has several important functions\n\n[00:51] So these two genomes are physically separated it's pretty crazy you have two genomes in two different locations in each of your cells\n\n[01:00] While the nuclear genome is nicely protected in a nucleus with advanced DNA repair systems\n\n[01:05] The mitochondrial DNA is stuck in a mitochondria and mitochondria have pretty archaic if any DNA repair systems\n\n[01:12] also\n\n[01:13] It has been argued although not everyone fully appreciates this to its full extent that mitochondrial deletions are actively selected\n\n[01:20] For because mitochondrial genomes are governed by bacterial population genetics or originating from prokaryotes that at some point\n\n[01:28] Got carried into our cells\n\n[01:30] But most importantly as far as we're concerned is that the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes need to communicate they together form\n\n[01:39] energy-producing complexes in the mitochondria\n\n[01:41] So without this communication the cell is at loss and healthy mitochondria are central to almost any cellular process that you can think of\n\n[01:49] Cellular health and mitochondria are intertwined and interconnected\n\n[01:54] That also means that if something goes wrong in a communication for instance regarding mutations regarding deletions\n\n[02:01] The cell health goes downhill\n\n[02:04] We're talking about many different aspects one of which I'll highlight\n\n[02:08] Late onset diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are carefully intertwined with mitochondria\n\n[02:13] What kind of pushed us over the edge about half a year ago looking at this project and saying okay\n\n[02:19] Should we do this? Yes, or no was a pretty recent discovery where Rodriguez Nuevo at all showed that human oocytes\n\n[02:27] Actually carry some implications in natural evolution, too\n\n[02:31] So nature kind of did two things regarding mitochondria and mitochondrial genomes\n\n[02:36] First of all almost all genes have been moved to the nucleus in the course of human evolution and in the course of evolution\n\n[02:42] Of any species that we sequence to date\n\n[02:45] So more than a thousand of our mitochondrial genes are already in the nucleus\n\n[02:49] We have only 13 left\n\n[02:50] The second thing that nature did in one of the most important cell types that we cannot have aging in the course of our lifespan\n\n[02:56] Human X cells is that nature silenced complex one complex one is the most\n\n[03:02] Reactive oxygen species producing complex in our cells we produce energy\n\n[03:05] We produce Ross and complex one in oocytes is actually silenced so that kind of pushed us over the edge and saying okay\n\n[03:12] This is definitely something we need to look into and further investigate\n\n[03:16] This is what we're going to do or place will place those 13 genes under more robust control\n\n[03:20] No longer physically separated in the nuclear genome\n\n[03:24] So we're consolidating the human genome and this might sound pretty easy\n\n[03:28] I actually hear a lot like it's 13 genes. How hard can it be?\n\n[03:32] We don't call this a moonshot for nothing\n\n[03:35] What we have seen over the past decades is that several teams actually we have one of the team members mark sitting over there\n\n[03:41] He'll tell you that this is not easy several teams try this and we appreciate their efforts and we've learned a lot from what they've done\n\n[03:50] What we do differently is two things for one\n\n[03:52] We have a team that can tackle each of the regulatory levels involved in this problem\n\n[03:57] We have a team that tackles genome biology all the way down to RNA biology all the way down to protein engineering and you need that\n\n[04:04] Interdisciplinary team to tackle all these hurdles\n\n[04:07] But more importantly we now finally have the tech to actually do this\n\n[04:11] You need to do this systematically and at scale you cannot take just one gene and say yeah, maybe that works\n\n[04:16] We'll try this with the other 12 you need to do this systematically at scale and for that\n\n[04:20] We need several technologies that have only recently become available\n\n[04:24] So we're talking about large scale DNA synthesis to try out several different types of mutations and mitochondrial genes\n\n[04:30] We're talking about high throughput quality control to tackle each of those regulatory levels\n\n[04:34] I mentioned we're talking about structure prediction alpha fold for instance\n\n[04:37] Not just to model proteins that we haven't yet completely mapped but also to model newly designed proteins by our own hands\n\n[04:45] And then finally we're talking about protein language models\n\n[04:48] So machine learning driven gene design by which we take sequences from other organisms and say okay, what can they teach us?\n\n[04:55] So all of those different gene designs are put into gigantic gene design libraries that we then employ further\n\n[05:01] What we do with them is build an integrated platform for cellular pathway engineering along three different milestones\n\n[05:08] Milestone one we take synthetic mitochondrial DNA\n\n[05:12] Strangely enough the human mitochondrial DNA has never been synthesized assembled and cloned never been done. It's so small never been done\n\n[05:19] So what we do is we synthesize human mitochondrial DNA different versions plug that into mitochondria and plug those mitochondria back into cells and that way\n\n[05:27] We establish a large platform of 13 different cell lines with knockouts of each of those mitochondrial genes\n\n[05:33] We use that platform milestone to where we take all those gene design libraries that I just mentioned created by the state of the art\n\n[05:40] tech and\n\n[05:40] Plug them into the nucleus and follow through which gene designs work best and finally we take the best working gene designs and put them\n\n[05:48] Into the nucleus, but make sure they don't just work from the nucleus\n\n[05:53] But I also work across genotypes because geographically our mitochondrial DNA is different\n\n[05:58] But also work in a coordinated fashion in different cell types because different cell types have different energy needs\n\n[06:04] Now the question to you is as follows\n\n[06:08] So I've talked about three different milestones and I'm talking about as multi-year projects\n\n[06:12] We're thinking seven to ten years before we can have a vector ready that what we say can actually work in a human body\n\n[06:19] So these milestones are mostly scientific\n\n[06:22] Quite fundamental but there is a lot of exciting spin-off potential and a question to you is what did you hear?\n\n[06:28] Did you hear me say custom mitochondrial genomes?\n\n[06:31] What resonated well with you was that the contemporary mitochondrial biology by which we can finally plug into all of those new tools\n\n[06:37] CRISPR for instance for mitochondrial DNA to because that only works in a nucleus or did you hear me say, okay\n\n[06:43] We can actually integrate novel pathways with multiple genes. It's not just that one or two gene therapy vector\n\n[06:48] It's 13 genes and on so novel gene pathways integrated in a nuclear genome\n\n[06:54] So we'd love to talk more with you and please feel free to ask us any question or email Chris Matiormi at founders at\n\n[07:01] biohouse.bio\n\n[07:18] Yeah, there are many different versions and strangely enough this has been not this hasn't been extensively researched\n\n[07:24] There have been some older studies that also suggest that you can for instance\n\n[07:28] Pretel\n\n[07:29] cancerous mutations from mitochondrial DNA rather than nuclear DNA\n\n[07:33] But there's remarkably little as known is also difficult to sequence mitochondrial DNA is difficult to isolate it\n\n[07:39] There's also a lot of pieces of mitochondrial DNA that get transferred to the nucleus\n\n[07:43] Without having a function a recent study on 66,000 patients in the UK biobank showed that this transfer happens all the time\n\n[07:51] So it's there's some technical difficulties, but also a lack of interest. I would say because the focus has always been on the nuclear genome\n\n[08:08] Yeah, I mean those are two questions I think right so one\n\n[08:11] Why are they still there a lot of hypotheses happy happy to talk about that the other question is what?\n\n[08:17] Background do we need to use and which genes versions do we need to plug in what we actually plan to do is\n\n[08:24] Not just have one donor from whose initial cells we work, but have a panel of donors are spread across geographical regions\n\n[08:31] To indeed take this difference into account. It's a super interesting question from any different perspective. Yeah\n\n[08:38] So you already mentioned that there are multiple\n\n[08:42] Chanks of mitochondrial DNA sitting in the nuclear genome already. Well, you know more about that than I\n\n[08:48] Have you thought of just turning those on?\n\n[08:51] Yeah, unfortunately, none of them are functional or so it appears\n\n[08:55] But yes, there are some really interesting kind of findings that we can definitely use although most people argue this process is random\n\n[09:03] Actually new mites as these pieces are called\n\n[09:06] appear to be or play a large role in cancer too because they of course can insert themselves into\n\n[09:12] Repressors for instance and then do that browse cause cancer\n\n[09:27] No, it's not a V those the the size limits of that are are too restricting for this project\n\n[09:32] So which will be about 10 KB. So we're talking the biggest gene vector that we've seen\n\n[09:37] In this regard so this is happening in five to seven years from now in our estimates\n\n[09:42] And we do think we can rely on gene therapy improving up to that point to what we would now use\n\n[09:48] We already see what is possible\n\n[09:50] But at very low efficiency is large serine recombinases which can insert large pieces of DNA and specific sites into the human genome\n\n[09:56] We work with this in our own lab, too\n\n[09:59] But we do think there needs to be some advancement in that area which we do expect in the next couple years\n\n[10:10] Yes, so it ties a bit into the biomarker\n\n[10:13] Area I would I would say but as I mentioned at the start what we need to hear from you is\n\n[10:20] Why you wouldn't take this gene therapy vector in seven to ten years? So\n\n[10:26] What's wrong and\n\n[10:27] What data would you like to see because we can we're generating data now, right? We're doing this project\n\n[10:33] We're removing this pushing this forward\n\n[10:35] So we need to know from you what would convince you and possibly also the person your neighbor\n\n[10:40] Who's not that interested in longevity, but perhaps is interested in health span. What data would they like to see?\n\n[10:49] So which data convinces you to use yourself\n\n[10:55] for gene therapy clinical trials"

Authenticate.\n\n[00:07] Lima, Whiskey, Niner.\n\n[00:17] Message received.\n\n[00:20] Amongst the sea of agents, there's a mole.\n\n[00:22] We can't openly communicate. I can only trust a select few.\n\n[00:37] I need to exchange crucial information without anyone noticing.\n\n[00:45] There's a massive yet hidden chain of command operating behind the scenes. I'm only privy to a small part of it.\n\n[00:53] There's been too many leaks.\n\n[01:03] Stop. We're not here to talk about espionage.\n\n[01:06] Believe it or not, the processes on your computer face a similar communication challenge every single day.\n\n[01:12] The issue of secure interprocess communication has been a critical part of computer architecture for decades.\n\n[01:19] Today we're here to talk about one of the most influential implementations of interprocess communication that affects billions of devices worldwide, the Android Binder.\n\n[01:30] Let's get wired in.\n\n[01:34] Interprocess communication, Laila Bandroid.\n\n[01:39] Alright, I'm going to level with you.\n\n[01:41] What we're about to dive into isn't your average tech tutorial.\n\n[01:45] We're about to embark on a journey through one of the most complex and most crucial systems in modern mobile computing.\n\n[01:52] This video is going to be dense. It's going to be technical.\n\n[01:55] And at times it might even be a bit challenging.\n\n[01:58] But here's the thing. If you stick with me, if you push through those moments of confusion, you're going to come out the other side with a deep understanding of something that affects billions of devices worldwide.\n\n[02:10] You're not just going to learn about Android.\n\n[02:12] You're going to understand how modern operating systems coordinate their internal components, how they seamlessly communicate between apps and how they manage to do so without us even realizing it.\n\n[02:25] Let's begin with our foundational problem.\n\n[02:28] How can two separate programs communicate with each other without compromising the system's security or efficiency?\n\n[02:35] In computers, we often have multiple processes running simultaneously, each in its own isolated memory space.\n\n[02:42] These processes need to share information with each other and coordinate their actions, much like two spies needing to transfer some critical information between each other.\n\n[02:53] Seems deceivingly simple. Just have one process write data somewhere and the other person read it.\n\n[03:00] Whoa, did you see that? We just opened up a huge can of worms.\n\n[03:05] First of all, how is the other process or spy supposed to know when new data is available?\n\n[03:11] What if we both try to write data at the same time?\n\n[03:14] How do we make sure that data doesn't get corrupted or tampered with during transfer?\n\n[03:19] And how do we maintain security so that no other prying eyes see what we're doing?\n\n[03:25] I think we better slow down for a second before we get too deep in the weeds.\n\n[03:29] Let's talk about the first thing we need to implement. Process isolation.\n\n[03:34] Early computers ran one process at a time, so process isolation was a non-issue.\n\n[03:40] But with the advent of multitasking operating systems, we now have to worry about this.\n\n[03:45] Think about it. If all processes are open, no data is private.\n\n[03:53] Not only that, but if one process crashes, the whole system can crash.\n\n[03:59] One of the first computers to implement process isolation was the Atlas supercomputer in 1962,\n\n[04:09] which I've actually made a previous video on if you'd like to learn more.\n\n[04:13] But how does process isolation work in a modern context and more specifically in Android context?\n\n[04:20] At the end of the day, Android is built on top of the Linux kernel, which gives us some core security features for free.\n\n[04:27] Each process in a Linux system is assigned a unique process ID or PID for short.\n\n[04:33] The PID is used in the kernel to track and manage the process, also ensuring that each process has its own virtual address space.\n\n[04:42] The memory management unit of the CPU, along with the Linux kernel, ensures that processes can only access their own allocated memory and not the memory of other processes.\n\n[04:54] Now, there can be some tricky exceptions to this, but for the most part, that's how it works.\n\n[04:59] Android does something a little special, though, that is a bit unconventional compared to what you would expect from, say, a desktop or server Linux installation.\n\n[05:10] By default, for each app that is installed, Android assigns a unique user ID or UID for short.\n\n[05:17] In other words, each Android app runs as a separate Linux user.\n\n[05:22] Each UID gets its own directory protecting processes and file systems from other applications.\n\n[05:29] It's kind of like putting special documents in a folder.\n\n[05:36] If I'm program A, we each get our own separate folder to store our own data in.\n\n[05:43] Neither of us by default can see the contents of other programs folders.\n\n[05:48] We're sandboxed by default.\n\n[05:50] And now if program B crashes, I can continue to run just fine.\n\n[05:58] So there you have it. We've solved the issue of process isolation, at least at a basic level.\n\n[06:03] We have security, but no ability to communicate.\n\n[06:08] Let's go back to our spy scenario.\n\n[06:10] We have two agents and they need to exchange items with each other.\n\n[06:14] What's the simplest way that I can achieve this?\n\n[06:16] I could just leave the item here in the open and they're able to stumble across it, especially if they know exactly where to look.\n\n[06:24] It's not great from a security standpoint, but it is a start.\n\n[06:28] Just like our agents have to communicate, processes in a computer system actually have to communicate all the time.\n\n[06:35] One of the earliest examples of interprocess communication came from the IBM System 360 introduced in 1964.\n\n[06:43] Its operating system, OS 360, had to manage multiple jobs running concurrently, necessitating some form of job to job communication.\n\n[06:52] The solution was simple, albeit primitive.\n\n[06:55] Jobs could communicate by reading and writing from a shared area.\n\n[06:59] Later, in the 70s, early UNIX systems followed a similar methodology.\n\n[07:04] It was quite common for programmers to use the slash temp directory as a common ground for simple interprocess communication.\n\n[07:12] This method also aligned well with UNIX's everything is a file philosophy.\n\n[07:17] So if we have two processes that are otherwise sandboxed from each other, we now have this special slash temp folder that each of us can read and write from to exchange information.\n\n[07:28] Let's think about how this would work in an Android context.\n\n[07:31] Say you've written some notes in a note taking app and now you want to send it in your email application, which is a separate sandboxed process.\n\n[07:39] One of the simpler ways we could solve this is a variation of the UNIX philosophy.\n\n[07:45] In Android, it's fairly common for applications to have read and write access to the SD card directory.\n\n[07:51] We could just dump what we need in there and read it when the time comes.\n\n[07:55] Let's hop into the computer and examine how this would look on a real system.\n\n[07:59] Now, what I've done here is I've created two example Android applications.\n\n[08:03] One is a very simple notepad application and the other is a very simple email application.\n\n[08:09] And they're going to be using the SD card to send information between the two applications.\n\n[08:15] Now, the notepad app is going to write to the SD card and the email app is going to read from the SD card since both applications have access to this shared directory.\n\n[08:25] If we take a quick look at the notepad application, you can see it's just writing to SD card notepad shared dot text.\n\n[08:32] And then the email application is going to be taking values from SD card notepad shared dot text and then adding that to its display up here.\n\n[08:41] Let's take a quick look at what that looks like when it's executing.\n\n[08:44] First, let's see. There's nothing inside of our SD card except the regular things.\n\n[08:48] There's no shared file. So let's run our notepad application.\n\n[08:52] Here we have it. Let's add a note, a special note.\n\n[08:56] I have a mission for you.\n\n[09:03] And let's send this to our email application.\n\n[09:06] Share. You can see we successfully saved this to the SD card.\n\n[09:10] So now we have this notepad shared dot text that is now available for the other application to read in.\n\n[09:18] Let's go to our email app and see if that worked.\n\n[09:20] My email. Sure enough, our email is ready to go.\n\n[09:23] I have a mission for you. In case you didn't realize it, we've got a pretty major problem here.\n\n[09:27] There's effectively no security.\n\n[09:29] Any malicious application that has read write access to the SD card can now spy on all interprocess communication of our primitive example.\n\n[09:38] Clearly, a more robust solution is necessary in order to create a secure operating system.\n\n[09:44] Agent, we've detected a breach in our communication protocols.\n\n[09:48] The dead drop system is compromised.\n\n[09:51] We have reason to believe enemy Intel is intercepting our messages.\n\n[09:55] Understood. When's our next move, Colonel?\n\n[09:57] We're switching to a more secure method.\n\n[09:59] I've arranged for a courier to deliver your next mission briefing in person.\n\n[10:03] This ensures the Intel reaches you and only you.\n\n[10:07] Roger that. When is the rendezvous?\n\n[10:09] Now.\n\n[10:18] Much like our spy agents, a significant improvement can be made in the security of interprocess communication by sending messages process to process\n\n[10:27] instead of just a shared area that anybody could stumble upon.\n\n[10:30] It's difficult to say exactly which early computer system was the first to widely implement more sophisticated IPC mechanisms.\n\n[10:38] There was a lot of interesting competition between various academic and commercial settings.\n\n[10:44] That being said, Multics developed as a collaboration between the two companies.\n\n[10:50] In the mid 1960s was one of the earlier systems to implement advanced IPC techniques such as interprocess signaling.\n\n[10:58] Later in the 1970s, Bell Labs introduced pipes as the fundamental IPC mechanism of Unix,\n\n[11:05] a unidirectional point to point scheme that was developed by the company.\n\n[11:11] In today's era of computing, modern operating systems such as Android support more complex interactions between processes.\n\n[11:19] Binder is the main IPC system of Android.\n\n[11:23] But before we get deeper into how exactly the binder works, let's reestablish the fundamental problem here.\n\n[11:30] We've got process isolation. We've got indirect communication.\n\n[11:34] Now we want a method of direct communication between processes to improve our security posture.\n\n[11:41] Going back to our example notes and email applications, let's talk about the setup.\n\n[11:46] Instead of just copying our notes app output to any shared area, we want to use the same method to create a new network.\n\n[11:55] Let's talk about the setup. Instead of just copying our notes app output to any shared directory that any application can read from,\n\n[12:03] including malicious ones, it would be better to send it point to point.\n\n[12:08] We can't go into all the details yet, and this is an oversimplification.\n\n[12:12] But what if we imagined a third application, this black box we call the binder that handles all the processing and delivery of messages for us.\n\n[12:22] That way, the notes app can communicate with the email app seemingly directly, with our special courier making sure our messages get to the right place.\n\n[12:31] Let's look at some code. Now I've added the next level of sophistication inside of my example notepad app and example email app so that we can facilitate direct app to app communication.\n\n[12:42] This way, we don't have to use the SD card as a shared directory that any application could potentially get access to.\n\n[12:49] If we take a look at the email code, there's a brand new communication service that's been added to the code, and this is going to be able to handle messages directly from incoming applications.\n\n[13:00] You can see we're using our special binder to be able to facilitate this kind of communication.\n\n[13:06] If we go over to our notepad app, we have a connection that's going to be made to this service that's being exposed inside of the email application.\n\n[13:15] It's going to be able to connect to this service, bind to it successfully, and then be able to send messages directly to that email application.\n\n[13:24] We're even going to be able to see that the notepad app can now directly trigger the email application instead of having to go around through different applications and go notepad and then email.\n\n[13:35] Let's execute our new applications.\n\n[13:39] I'm going to go over to my emulator, and first of all, we have our new version of the notepad application.\n\n[13:45] So let's type a special message.\n\n[13:48] I have a mission for you.\n\n[13:53] And now before we had to send this, write this to the SD card, and then open up the email application ourselves.\n\n[13:59] But here we can just click share.\n\n[14:02] And now we directly have our special message inside of our email application.\n\n[14:06] All this is well and good, but we're making some pretty heavy assumptions here.\n\n[14:10] What is this mysterious program? Who is delivering these messages?\n\n[14:14] And why do I, as the program, know so little of what's happening behind the scenes?\n\n[14:27] Much like our hidden courier delivering messages between agents, Android has a courier of its own.\n\n[14:33] Binder is the main interprocess communication system for Android, but it actually predates Android by a significant amount.\n\n[14:40] Binder started off as a project called OpenBinder by B-Ink for their BOS operating system at the tail end of the 1990s.\n\n[14:49] B-Ink was then acquired by Palm Inc., known for their personal digital assistants, most famously Palm Pilot.\n\n[14:58] Palm eventually split off a subsidiary to license their mobile operating system, Palm OS.\n\n[15:04] And development of OpenBinder continued under this new Palm Source division.\n\n[15:09] Palm ended up switching to Linux instead of a microkernel-based OS, so Binder was then ported over to Linux and open sourced around 2005.\n\n[15:19] Diane Hackborn, one of the key engineers of OpenBinder, was hired by Google to join the Android team.\n\n[15:26] The Android team quickly realized that a robust yet efficient IPC was needed for their OS.\n\n[15:31] Being that OpenBinder was already ported to Linux and their hardware target was a measly 200MHz ARM device, using OpenBinder as the main IPC mechanism for Android was a no-brainer.\n\n[15:44] OpenBinder was used as-is in the early versions of Android, but was eventually completely rewritten in 2008.\n\n[15:51] Today's Binder may look quite different from those early iterations, however, many of the core principles remain the same.\n\n[15:58] That's enough of a history lesson, let's talk about how it works.\n\n[16:01] As I mentioned earlier, Binder is the main interprocess communication system for Android.\n\n[16:06] It spans across two different worlds, kernel space and user space, to perform its duties.\n\n[16:12] The kernel space implementation is necessary to give Binder the permissions it needs to be able to communicate and send messages across processes.\n\n[16:21] Remember, we can't use a file system-based interprocess communication mechanism because in Android we lack a world-writable directory from the application side for security reasons.\n\n[16:33] The user space portion of the Binder is required so that applications are able to communicate to Binder, much like a mail person, each application sends its interprocess messages, or letters, over to Binder in user space.\n\n[16:47] Binder is implemented in user space as classes inside the Android framework that applications can call whenever they have a message for another app.\n\n[16:56] The kernel space area of the Binder is actually implemented as a kernel driver, which handles many low-level operations.\n\n[17:03] Managing memory and transmitting data across processes are all handled in kernel space.\n\n[17:09] The binder driver in the kernel creates a file, known as a device file, at slash dev slash binder,\n\n[17:16] which serves as the gateway for processes in user space to send commands and data to the binder driver.\n\n[17:23] Classes inside the Android system make the direct IOCTL system calls to this file to send messages.\n\n[17:30] This shields application developers from the complexity of direct communication.\n\n[17:36] Instead, devs can use high-level Android APIs, which act as a proxy, handling the IPC operations underneath.\n\n[17:44] This way, app devs can focus on application logic instead of all the technical details of interprocess communication.\n\n[17:51] Pretty neat, right? Let's take a look at where the real binder file is located on an Android device.\n\n[17:57] I currently have my Android emulator running over here, and so I'm going to get a shell to that.\n\n[18:02] Let's do ADB shell, then run a super user, and let's change directories to our slash dev directory,\n\n[18:10] and then list out all the files and folders inside of this directory.\n\n[18:15] And I'm going to grab for anything binder related. Here we go.\n\n[18:21] So here you can see our binder gateway file to the binder driver.\n\n[18:26] Now you may also notice there are multiple other binder related files in this directory.\n\n[18:31] The slash dev slash binder file is used for general purpose binder communication across apps and services,\n\n[18:39] but sometimes there are also other device files for hardware specific needs, for example,\n\n[18:45] or vendor specific needs for binder communication.\n\n[18:48] Now even though there are sometimes different binder device files exposed,\n\n[18:52] they still interface with the same binder driver underneath.\n\n[19:08] By routing all of our agents' communication through headquarters,\n\n[19:13] we've successfully solved the issue of our assets otherwise being isolated from each other.\n\n[19:18] The security risks are now mitigated, and the burden of safeguarding messages now falls on HQ,\n\n[19:23] not the individual agents.\n\n[19:25] But if I'm being pretty honest, it's getting quite overwhelming here.\n\n[19:29] Messages of various data types are flowing in from agents' databases,\n\n[19:33] SD cards, phone calls, letters, secure radio transmissions, and more.\n\n[19:38] We don't really have a centralized process to handle this amount of data\n\n[19:42] or to route information in a logical manner.\n\n[19:45] There's got to be a better way.\n\n[19:48] Let's think about this from a computing perspective.\n\n[19:52] Now that we've got an actual mechanism for sending messages back and forth,\n\n[19:56] we can actually use this to send messages back and forth.\n\n[20:00] Now that we've got an actual mechanism for sending messages back and forth\n\n[20:04] between applications using the Android binder,\n\n[20:07] we still need to establish some sort of organizational process.\n\n[20:11] And there's a few different topics that we need to consider.\n\n[20:15] How do we decide what order to send messages in?\n\n[20:18] Also, how do we keep track of when messages have already been sent,\n\n[20:22] or even store messages that still need to be sent?\n\n[20:25] Among the various data structures available to us,\n\n[20:28] this is probably the most logical choice.\n\n[20:31] To give an overview, a queue is a concept in computer science\n\n[20:34] for handling data in a specific order.\n\n[20:37] Standard queues work in a first-in, first-out order, or FIFO for short.\n\n[20:42] Essentially, this means that the first item to arrive\n\n[20:46] is also going to be the first item processed and then removed.\n\n[20:53] In the context of Android's binder,\n\n[20:56] it means that messages are going to be processed\n\n[20:59] in the order in which they have been received.\n\n[21:01] The binder driver oversees these message queues\n\n[21:04] for every single Android app or service\n\n[21:07] that wants to make an interprocess communication request.\n\n[21:10] Going back to our spy analogy,\n\n[21:13] think of it like a list of messages from each agent\n\n[21:16] that needs to be organized and processed.\n\n[21:19] Generally, each binder object in a process is allocated\n\n[21:22] an incoming queue and an outgoing queue.\n\n[21:25] Think of it like your inbox and outbox.\n\n[21:28] The outgoing queue stores and manages messages\n\n[21:31] generated by the current process that are destined for other processes.\n\n[21:35] Conversely, the inbound queue collects and holds messages\n\n[21:39] sent by other processes that are intended for the current process to receive.\n\n[21:43] Each message request is encapsulated as a transaction.\n\n[21:47] Each transaction contains a parcel,\n\n[21:50] which is a data structure that stores the actual payload and metadata.\n\n[21:54] This parcel acts as a standardized container\n\n[21:57] for serializing and deserializing data types\n\n[22:00] across process boundaries.\n\n[22:03] The binder driver is like headquarters.\n\n[22:06] It serves as the central manager for processing all IPC transactions\n\n[22:10] sent over the device.\n\n[22:13] Whew, that was a lot.\n\n[22:16] One extra note for you Android developers out there.\n\n[22:19] Each Android application or service making IPC requests\n\n[22:23] actually creates a dedicated binder object\n\n[22:26] that serves as a proxy for communication\n\n[22:29] with the binder driver on the backend.\n\n[22:32] In other words, going back to our spy scenario,\n\n[22:35] HQ handles all the behind-the-scenes work,\n\n[22:38] sorting, routing, and delivering messages,\n\n[22:41] but each agent only needs to interact with HQ to do so.\n\n[22:45] Pretty neat, right?\n\n[22:49] If HQ only accepted one type of data,\n\n[22:52] it would severely limit the information that could be shared,\n\n[22:55] making some missions impossible.\n\n[22:58] Agents should be able to send whatever type of intelligence\n\n[23:01] they gather without limitations.\n\n[23:04] The data is stored in a container,\n\n[23:07] which is a container that is used to store data\n\n[23:10] and is used to store data.\n\n[23:13] The data is stored in a container,\n\n[23:16] and the data is stored in a container\n\n[23:19] that is used to store data.\n\n[23:22] The data is stored in a container\n\n[23:25] that is used to store data.\n\n[23:28] At each HQ, we have to efficiently process\n\n[23:31] diverse information without needing separate divisions\n\n[23:34] for each data type.\n\n[23:37] Similar to how the agency is able to process\n\n[23:40] diverse forms of information from their operatives,\n\n[23:43] we have the ability to process data\n\n[23:46] from the agency itself.\n\n[23:49] The data is stored in a container\n\n[23:52] that is used to store data.\n\n[23:55] The data is stored in a container\n\n[23:58] that is used to store data.\n\n[24:01] It's a little different from the data\n\n[24:04] that we can use to process data.\n\n[24:07] The data is stored in a container\n\n[24:10] that is used to store data.\n\n[24:13] Partial objects also support custom objects\n\n[24:16] created and defined by Android developers.\n\n[24:18] It's kind of like letting our spy agents\n\n[24:21] give HQ custom data.\n\n[24:24] As long as they tell HQ how to decrypt\n\n[24:27] their messages, almost anything goes.\n\n[24:30] To send custom data in Android,\n\n[24:33] developers simply need to implement a special interface\n\n[24:36] called parcelable, which is provided by the Android framework.\n\n[24:39] how it should be handled.\n\n[24:40] Serialization and flattening of parcel data\n\n[24:43] are optional techniques that a developer can\n\n[24:45] use for additional optimization.\n\n[24:48] It's really the best of both worlds.\n\n[24:50] The Android framework provides methods\n\n[24:52] to simplify the process of writing and reading\n\n[24:54] data from parcels.\n\n[24:56] But developers also have flexibility\n\n[24:58] for how they implement these for their particular needs.\n\n[25:02] Going back to our spy scenario, it's\n\n[25:03] kind of like how HQ can give agents suggestions and tooling\n\n[25:07] for sending their messages.\n\n[25:09] But if they need something more custom,\n\n[25:11] they still have the ability to do so.\n\n[25:15] Skilled as they may be, we don't expect our agents\n\n[25:18] to be experts in everything.\n\n[25:20] Hence why, here at HQ, we equip our operatives\n\n[25:23] with a covert radio transmission system.\n\n[25:25] Welcome.\n\n[25:26] Channel load one.\n\n[25:31] This system abstracts away many of the complex security\n\n[25:34] steps they would normally have to take to communicate with us.\n\n[25:37] As long as the agent sends us the message\n\n[25:39] in the format we're expecting, it's\n\n[25:41] a speedy way to get a message to HQ without additional fuss.\n\n[25:47] Remember when we were talking earlier\n\n[25:49] about all the different ways Android developers can\n\n[25:51] interact with parcel objects?\n\n[25:54] It can get pretty brittle and challenging\n\n[25:56] to interface with these low-level implementations\n\n[25:58] directly.\n\n[26:00] Wouldn't it be nice if we had some sort of abstraction,\n\n[26:03] something like a wrapper?\n\n[26:06] One of the most used wrappers around Binder\n\n[26:09] includes a very special message type in Android, intents.\n\n[26:13] Much like the covert radio systems\n\n[26:15] that HQ gives the agents, intents\n\n[26:18] are a quick way to transmit data that gets\n\n[26:20] rid of a lot of the hard stuff.\n\n[26:23] Intents are one of the most common methods\n\n[26:25] for IPC within Android.\n\n[26:27] Services, applications, and even components\n\n[26:29] inside of applications use intent objects\n\n[26:32] to transmit data.\n\n[26:33] For example, let's say you're in the Yelp app\n\n[26:36] and you decide to try out a new sushi restaurant.\n\n[26:39] You click on the address of the restaurant,\n\n[26:41] and it magically opens up the address in Google Maps.\n\n[26:44] How did Google Maps know it needed to be open?\n\n[26:47] And how did it know which address to go to?\n\n[26:50] Underneath, the Yelp application is simply\n\n[26:52] sending an intent message defining\n\n[26:54] what kind of action needs to be performed,\n\n[26:56] as well as what data is relevant, which in this case\n\n[26:59] is the destination address.\n\n[27:01] Google Maps is listening for these messages\n\n[27:03] and has defined that it's going to open up\n\n[27:06] the address defined inside of the intent object.\n\n[27:09] So next time you're using an Android phone,\n\n[27:12] take a moment to notice that most of these interactions\n\n[27:15] between applications are silently calling\n\n[27:17] the binder on the back end.\n\n[27:26] This is your new identity.\n\n[27:28] Memorize every detail.\n\n[27:30] Your name, your history, they no longer exist.\n\n[27:34] This is who you are now.\n\n[27:36] The document also contains a secure ID code.\n\n[27:39] That cipher is how we will deliver messages to you.\n\n[27:43] This radio is your lifeline.\n\n[27:45] Missions will get routed through that radio,\n\n[27:47] encrypted through your cipher.\n\n[27:50] We have all your information in our database.\n\n[27:53] The old you dies today.\n\n[27:55] Don't mess this up.\n\n[28:00] While we've addressed message formatting,\n\n[28:02] storage, and transmission,\n\n[28:03] we still have other challenges to consider.\n\n[28:06] One of the more interesting aspects\n\n[28:08] of interprocess communication\n\n[28:10] is message routing and service discovery.\n\n[28:13] A fascinating historical example of service discovery\n\n[28:16] comes from an experimental operating system\n\n[28:19] developed at Xerox's park in the late 1970s.\n\n[28:23] The researchers created an operating system called Cedar\n\n[28:26] built on top of the Mesa programming language.\n\n[28:29] One of Cedar's key features\n\n[28:31] was a component called clearing house.\n\n[28:34] Clearing house was a network-wide\n\n[28:35] naming and authentication system.\n\n[28:38] Clearing house provided a hierarchical namespace\n\n[28:41] for naming and locating resources,\n\n[28:43] including services, across a distributed network.\n\n[28:47] Processes on the system could use clearing house\n\n[28:50] to look up and connect to services\n\n[28:52] across the distributed system.\n\n[28:54] Let's examine this from the perspective\n\n[28:55] of the centralized manager of Android, the binder.\n\n[28:59] Picture this, you have a ton of messages formatted,\n\n[29:02] queued up, and otherwise ready to go.\n\n[29:05] As the message manager,\n\n[29:06] how do you know where to deliver each message?\n\n[29:09] To effectively route the messages,\n\n[29:11] each message requires a target location.\n\n[29:14] Message recipients would need to register beforehand\n\n[29:17] with address and delivery details\n\n[29:19] in order to receive their messages.\n\n[29:22] In Android, this is solved\n\n[29:23] with something called service manager.\n\n[29:26] The service manager serves as the centralized registry\n\n[29:29] where both system services and applications\n\n[29:33] can register themselves to receive messages via the binder.\n\n[29:36] Each client must register under a unique name,\n\n[29:39] much like how each agent has a unique contact address\n\n[29:43] so that other processes can specify\n\n[29:45] their service name as the target.\n\n[29:48] When an app or service needs to send a message\n\n[29:50] to another service, it queries the service manager\n\n[29:53] with the destination service name.\n\n[29:56] The service manager then returns a binder object,\n\n[29:58] which the sender can then use to communicate\n\n[30:01] with the intended recipient.\n\n[30:03] Remember, because Android is an open source operating system\n\n[30:06] at the end of the day,\n\n[30:08] we can take a look at the real source code\n\n[30:10] to see how service discovery works\n\n[30:12] in a modern operating system.\n\n[30:14] Here we're taking a look at the actual Android source code.\n\n[30:17] Remember those unique names\n\n[30:19] that services have to register under?\n\n[30:21] This is how the actual Android system\n\n[30:23] names common services running on the device.\n\n[30:26] If you're an Android developer,\n\n[30:28] some of these might look familiar to you.\n\n[30:31] There is the phone service, for example,\n\n[30:33] that is registered for getting the telephony manager.\n\n[30:37] This lets you use all the different telephony features\n\n[30:40] on the device, like making a phone call, for example.\n\n[30:43] If we scroll down, we can find the clipboard service\n\n[30:47] for retrieving the clipboard manager.\n\n[30:50] This lets you access or modify contents\n\n[30:53] of the Android clipboard.\n\n[30:54] And there are so many other services on here as well.\n\n[30:58] If you're curious, try looking at this file\n\n[31:00] in the Android source code\n\n[31:02] and check out all the different services\n\n[31:04] that you never knew were running\n\n[31:05] in the background of your device.\n\n[31:07] You can find relevant links\n\n[31:09] in the comments section of this video.\n\n[31:12] Who is this? What's going on?\n\n[31:14] WIMA, WISKY, POUR.\n\n[31:16] Access denied.\n\n[31:17] Unauthorized attempt detected.\n\n[31:19] Override.\n\n[31:21] Warning. Unauthorized access detected.\n\n[31:24] Security protocols engaged.\n\n[31:26] This incident will be reported.\n\n[31:28] Insufficient clearance for classified data.\n\n[31:31] Terminating connection.\n\n[31:33] That transmission was not successful.\n\n[31:35] The device is not working.\n\n[31:37] The device is not working.\n\n[31:39] That transmission was not on any of our approved channels.\n\n[31:42] It could be the enemy trying to...\n\n[31:51] In the Android world, despite the centralized manager's\n\n[31:54] comprehensive knowledge of all service locations\n\n[31:56] within the system,\n\n[31:58] communication between services and applications\n\n[32:00] is restricted based on predefined access rules.\n\n[32:04] This is an essential component\n\n[32:07] of maintaining the security of the overall system.\n\n[32:09] Services can specify permissions\n\n[32:11] required for communication.\n\n[32:13] Clients must then request the appropriate privileges\n\n[32:16] before attempting to interact with these services.\n\n[32:19] The Android system verifies the necessary permissions\n\n[32:22] are met prior to initiating\n\n[32:24] any requested binder transactions.\n\n[32:26] Applications are able to declare the permissions\n\n[32:29] they intend to request\n\n[32:31] within their main configuration file\n\n[32:33] known as the Android manifest.\n\n[32:37] We have an urgent request for Agent 17.\n\n[32:40] Send them the mission data immediately.\n\n[32:42] Negative, Colonel.\n\n[32:44] Agent 17 is currently engaged, unable to comply.\n\n[32:47] Unacceptable.\n\n[32:49] Find me an alternative now.\n\n[32:51] This is time sensitive.\n\n[32:53] Roger that.\n\n[32:55] Scanning for available operatives in the vicinity.\n\n[32:57] Looks like several agents are on standby\n\n[32:59] awaiting deployment.\n\n[33:01] Good.\n\n[33:03] I expect results.\n\n[33:05] Don't let me down.\n\n[33:07] Understood, Colonel.\n\n[33:09] I'll transmit the data to the most suitable candidate shortly.\n\n[33:11] Over and out.\n\n[33:13] We previously talked about how the binder uses\n\n[33:16] a queue-based architecture\n\n[33:18] for handling the transmission of messages.\n\n[33:20] The queue works well for ensuring messages\n\n[33:22] get received in a logical manner.\n\n[33:24] However, this approach raises some questions\n\n[33:26] about efficiency.\n\n[33:28] After all, we are targeting mobile devices,\n\n[33:30] so resource usage is of the utmost importance.\n\n[33:34] If only there were a more optimal way\n\n[33:36] to handle message processing\n\n[33:38] while maintaining order integrity.\n\n[33:40] Thankfully, there is.\n\n[33:42] In order to bypass the inefficiencies\n\n[33:44] of transmitting only one message at a time,\n\n[33:46] the binder uses thread pools\n\n[33:48] to manage incoming message requests.\n\n[33:52] Thread pools allow the binder to add concurrency\n\n[33:54] and consequently the ability to process\n\n[33:56] multiple transactions simultaneously.\n\n[33:58] It works by having a pool of worker threads available\n\n[34:00] and inputting the message.\n\n[34:02] The pool also has worker threads available\n\n[34:04] at any given time,\n\n[34:06] dedicated to handling binder transactions as they come in.\n\n[34:08] This is similar to our spy scenario\n\n[34:10] where HQ keeps multiple agents\n\n[34:12] available for incoming messages.\n\n[34:14] When a new transaction or mission arrives,\n\n[34:16] it is assigned to one of the available threads,\n\n[34:18] aka agents, inside of the pool.\n\n[34:20] Once a transaction task is dispatched\n\n[34:22] to a processing thread,\n\n[34:24] it's also removed from the queue.\n\n[34:26] This allows the transaction queue\n\n[34:28] to maintain its original FIPO processing order.\n\n[34:30] Of course, just like HQ doesn't have infinite agents\n\n[34:32] to work with,\n\n[34:34] Android doesn't have an infinite amount of worker threads\n\n[34:36] in the pool.\n\n[34:38] There is still a maximum limit,\n\n[34:40] but processing messages in this way\n\n[34:42] is significantly more efficient\n\n[34:44] than transactions only being processed\n\n[34:46] one message at a time.\n\n[34:48] We've got a problem.\n\n[34:50] Agent 17 isn't responding to our signals.\n\n[34:52] Do you think they're burned?\n\n[34:54] No.\n\n[34:56] We're not.\n\n[34:59] Do you think they're burned?\n\n[35:01] It's possible.\n\n[35:03] Your team has been continuously sending intelligence\n\n[35:05] to a dead agent.\n\n[35:07] Stop wasting resources.\n\n[35:09] Your messages aren't going anywhere.\n\n[35:11] Understood.\n\n[35:13] Set up a system for your other agents\n\n[35:15] to have a dead man's switch or signal of some sort.\n\n[35:17] We have to have an indication\n\n[35:19] of when something is wrong.\n\n[35:21] Roger that, Colonel. I'll implement it right away.\n\n[35:23] Good.\n\n[35:25] We can't afford to lose any more intel.\n\n[35:27] We need to be alert out there.\n\n[35:29] While we've covered the essential aspects\n\n[35:31] of a fully functioning\n\n[35:33] interprocess communication system,\n\n[35:35] there are additional optimizations worth considering.\n\n[35:37] As computer scientists,\n\n[35:39] we should always be cognizant\n\n[35:41] of resource usage and efficiency,\n\n[35:43] especially on mobile platforms\n\n[35:45] where there are size, weight, and power limitations.\n\n[35:47] Much like the spy scenario,\n\n[35:49] we don't want applications communicating\n\n[35:51] with target services\n\n[35:53] that are otherwise dead or failing\n\n[35:56] that are otherwise dead or failed.\n\n[35:58] It's just a waste of resources.\n\n[36:00] Historically, one of the first systems\n\n[36:02] to handle death notifications in IPC\n\n[36:04] was the MAC Colonel,\n\n[36:06] developed at Carnegie Mellon University\n\n[36:08] in the mid-1980s.\n\n[36:10] In MAC, when a port,\n\n[36:12] think of it like an endpoint, was destroyed,\n\n[36:14] MAC would send a notification\n\n[36:16] to processes holding send rights\n\n[36:18] to that port.\n\n[36:20] Many of the concepts introduced in MAC\n\n[36:22] influenced much of the modern\n\n[36:24] operating system design.\n\n[36:26] In fact, if you're an iOS developer\n\n[36:28] or MAC developer,\n\n[36:30] you might recognize that name right away.\n\n[36:32] Ever heard of MACO binaries?\n\n[36:34] Apple's XNU kernel\n\n[36:36] is a derivative of the original\n\n[36:38] MAC Colonel from the mid-80s.\n\n[36:40] So you'll occasionally see terminology\n\n[36:42] related to the original system.\n\n[36:44] Alright, so now we know the history\n\n[36:46] of death notifications,\n\n[36:48] let's jump back into the modern era\n\n[36:50] and take a look at an Android example.\n\n[36:53] If an application is registered to communicate\n\n[36:55] with a target service that has died,\n\n[36:57] continued transactions would be\n\n[36:59] pretty inefficient. To fix this,\n\n[37:01] Binder uses a special kind\n\n[37:03] of notification, known as a\n\n[37:05] death notification, that allows clients\n\n[37:07] to gracefully handle unexpected\n\n[37:09] issues in the target process\n\n[37:11] they're communicating with.\n\n[37:13] The client app then attaches\n\n[37:15] a death recipient to the binder,\n\n[37:17] which lets the client app run\n\n[37:19] code to clean up resources,\n\n[37:21] or even reset the connection if the connected\n\n[37:23] process dies. This capability\n\n[37:25] allows applications to conserve\n\n[37:27] resources when errors happen.\n\n[37:29] Let's look at a real example.\n\n[37:31] Let's go back to our example, email\n\n[37:33] and notepad applications.\n\n[37:35] Now previously we had successfully\n\n[37:37] implemented app-to-app communication\n\n[37:39] using the binder.\n\n[37:41] But now we need to attach a death recipient\n\n[37:43] inside of our notepad application\n\n[37:45] to figure out when the email\n\n[37:47] service dies. And that's exactly\n\n[37:49] what we've got here inside of the code.\n\n[37:51] We have our returned binder object,\n\n[37:53] and we're attaching a death recipient\n\n[37:55] so that we can run code inside\n\n[37:57] of this client application\n\n[37:59] once the service dies.\n\n[38:01] Here we can see we're just running a simple\n\n[38:03] toast so that we can pop up a notification\n\n[38:05] on the screen to alert\n\n[38:07] the user that this service has\n\n[38:09] died. And if we take a look at our\n\n[38:11] example email application, I've\n\n[38:13] created an example purposeful\n\n[38:15] crash so that we can get our\n\n[38:18] service to die after 4 seconds\n\n[38:20] and trigger this death notification\n\n[38:22] inside of our notepad app.\n\n[38:24] Let's jump in and see what that looks like.\n\n[38:26] Let's open up the final versions of our\n\n[38:28] email and notepad applications\n\n[38:30] with the death recipient stored inside\n\n[38:32] of the notepad application connected\n\n[38:34] to the email service.\n\n[38:36] I'm going to open up my email service first.\n\n[38:38] And remember this has the\n\n[38:40] 4 second delay once a client\n\n[38:42] attaches so that we can\n\n[38:44] demonstrate that death notification occurring.\n\n[38:46] Now let's go to our notepad application\n\n[38:48] and that's going to automatically connect\n\n[38:50] to our email service.\n\n[38:52] Here we go. We can start typing our notes\n\n[38:54] but let's just wait for a second and see.\n\n[38:56] Yep, here we go.\n\n[38:58] We have our toast notification email service\n\n[39:00] died. So this is letting\n\n[39:02] us know that our email notification\n\n[39:04] app has actually crashed\n\n[39:06] and then the service that our client\n\n[39:08] notepad application was connected to\n\n[39:10] via the binder is not able to\n\n[39:12] connect anymore. With great power\n\n[39:15] comes great responsibility.\n\n[39:17] The centralized communications manager\n\n[39:19] is necessary but opens up\n\n[39:21] a large potential vulnerability.\n\n[39:23] In Android, the binder has\n\n[39:25] immense power within the system.\n\n[39:27] This also makes it one of the\n\n[39:29] largest targets for exploitation\n\n[39:31] and abuse. Compromising the\n\n[39:33] binder could potentially allow\n\n[39:35] a malicious application to gain\n\n[39:37] unauthorized access to critical\n\n[39:39] system resources and operations.\n\n[39:41] This breach could lead to\n\n[39:43] wide-ranging control over the device\n\n[39:45] affecting security, privacy,\n\n[39:47] and overall functionality.\n\n[39:49] Binder's size and complexity\n\n[39:51] exposes a large attack\n\n[39:53] surface. Its constant\n\n[39:55] parsing and transferring of application\n\n[39:57] data sent via messages\n\n[39:59] makes the binder a super ripe target.\n\n[40:01] Early versions of the\n\n[40:03] Android binder were susceptible to\n\n[40:05] transaction forgery, allowing\n\n[40:07] malicious applications to impersonate\n\n[40:09] other apps or services\n\n[40:12] and get access to data they shouldn't.\n\n[40:14] Over the years, there have been several other\n\n[40:16] severe binder vulnerabilities.\n\n[40:18] Some of which have even resulted\n\n[40:20] in malicious apps gaining power\n\n[40:22] to obtain arbitrary kernel read\n\n[40:24] and write privileges.\n\n[40:26] The severity of these vulnerabilities\n\n[40:28] is really as high as the privileges\n\n[40:30] that the binder has over the entire\n\n[40:32] Android system.\n\n[40:34] Project Zero, a vulnerability\n\n[40:36] research group at Google, has published\n\n[40:38] an interesting example of binder abuse\n\n[40:40] in the wild. In any case, security\n\n[40:42] is always a major concern\n\n[40:44] for any IPC system,\n\n[40:46] and Android is no exception.\n\n[40:48] It may be difficult to stay one\n\n[40:50] step ahead of the bad guy, but a\n\n[40:52] robust system design can mitigate\n\n[40:54] many of the risks that bad\n\n[40:56] actors could otherwise abuse.\n\n[40:58] As we've seen, the\n\n[41:00] Android binder is a powerful and complex\n\n[41:02] system that forms the backbone\n\n[41:04] of interprocess communication\n\n[41:06] in one of the world's most popular\n\n[41:08] operating systems.\n\n[41:10] With the rise of increasingly powerful\n\n[41:12] mobile hardware, I'm excited to see\n\n[41:14] what innovations the future will hold\n\n[41:16] for IPC systems.\n\n[41:18] Imagine this, enhanced security\n\n[41:20] features to combat ever-evolving\n\n[41:22] threats, more efficient data transfer\n\n[41:24] methods to conserve battery life,\n\n[41:26] or maybe even some ML\n\n[41:28] optimized message prioritization\n\n[41:30] could all be things we experience\n\n[41:32] in the near future.\n\n[41:34] But here's the exciting part, you don't\n\n[41:37] have to be a Google engineer to contribute\n\n[41:39] to this future. There's a whole\n\n[41:41] world of open source code out there.\n\n[41:43] Whether you're a seasoned\n\n[41:45] developer or just starting out,\n\n[41:47] understanding interprocess communication\n\n[41:49] systems like the binder\n\n[41:51] gives you a powerful toolkit.\n\n[41:53] And it's an often neglected area\n\n[41:55] of computer science that deserves\n\n[41:57] more attention. Remember, every\n\n[41:59] great technological advancement starts\n\n[42:01] with curiosity and a willingness\n\n[42:03] to dive deep into how things work.\n\n[42:05] The next breakthrough in IPC could come\n\n[42:07] from anyone, maybe even you.\n\n[42:09] If you're intrigued by what you've learned today,\n\n[42:11] I encourage you to explore further.\n\n[42:13] Check out the Android documentation,\n\n[42:15] experiment with different IPC\n\n[42:17] methods, read some research papers,\n\n[42:19] and don't be afraid to push\n\n[42:21] the boundaries of what's possible.\n\n[42:23] Thanks for joining me on this deep dive\n\n[42:25] into the Android binder. If you enjoyed\n\n[42:27] this style of content, don't forget to subscribe,\n\n[42:29] and until next time, Lori Wired out.\n\n[42:35] Thanks for watching."

        "transcription": "[00:00] Hi, Ron, welcome to Farsight's Biotech and Health Extension Group,\n\n[00:03] sponsored by 100 Plus Capital.\n\n[00:05] I'm really excited to have Jean-Auber back with us again.\n\n[00:08] I think it's maybe your third appearance here in one of the seminars.\n\n[00:11] And we've definitely had the luck to have you on for a lot of other workshops.\n\n[00:15] I think we got in touch for the first time a few years ago when you wrote\n\n[00:18] a really amazing book on the replacing paradigm to aging.\n\n[00:22] And yeah, you've since done a lot of research and now also have a really\n\n[00:26] wonderful company underway.\n\n[00:27] And so we thought that it would be really fun to invite you back, given that\n\n[00:30] replacing as now really mentioned, I think in the Amaranth Foundation and their\n\n[00:35] longevity bottleneck assessment in the longevity biotech fellowship roadmap.\n\n[00:39] And so I think it's just popping up a lot as a theme that is pretty undervalued\n\n[00:43] within longevity, but like really promising.\n\n[00:45] And so I'm really excited to have you here as to me, the pioneer who really\n\n[00:49] like first set the whole entire kind of like sub-domain within aging on the map,\n\n[00:53] at least for me.\n\n[00:55] So thanks a lot for joining, John.\n\n[00:56] And you'll be discussing replacement as the surest, fastest and cheapest way to\n\n[00:59] building aging.\n\n[01:00] And I will share a lot more about your bio in the chat, but without further\n\n[01:04] ado, thanks a lot for joining and the stage is yours.\n\n[01:07] Thanks so much, Alison, for having me again.\n\n[01:10] I hope you can hear me well enough.\n\n[01:14] Yeah, no, it's a pleasure to be back.\n\n[01:16] And it's nice to see that replacement is growing in appreciation in the field.\n\n[01:24] I think it's really because it deserves more attention and hope, maybe I'll\n\n[01:29] convince you of that today.\n\n[01:31] The title is a bit provocative, but I think it's totally defensible.\n\n[01:37] I am happy to discuss this.\n\n[01:39] I'll show a few slides and open to this being interactive and stimulating\n\n[01:46] discussion about this.\n\n[01:47] I'm going to be telling you about replacement and why I think it's the\n\n[01:52] surest and fastest and also cheapest way of building aging.\n\n[01:58] So first of all, why even consider a replacement as an approach to life\n\n[02:03] extension?\n\n[02:04] Let's start with an example.\n\n[02:07] I got this from Anar Isnan who posted this recently, but I think it's a pretty\n\n[02:12] illustrative picture.\n\n[02:13] This is the same person decades apart.\n\n[02:16] Some of you may recognize this person, Clint Eastwood, well-known actor and\n\n[02:22] director, but this is what aging does.\n\n[02:25] And what exactly is the difference that we're looking at here between the same\n\n[02:31] person decades apart?\n\n[02:33] And really what it is, is this accumulation of damage that occurs.\n\n[02:39] It's stochastic.\n\n[02:41] It's complex damage.\n\n[02:43] I've listed some of the forms of damage that are accumulated to protein over\n\n[02:47] time here, especially to long-lived percains.\n\n[02:50] These are just classes of damage.\n\n[02:52] So they each break down into different specific types of damage to the\n\n[02:58] percains.\n\n[02:59] So it's very complex.\n\n[03:00] It happens somewhat randomly.\n\n[03:02] This is not programmed.\n\n[03:05] And most importantly, it's non-enzymatic, meaning it's not a biological process.\n\n[03:11] It's really a physical process of the breakdown of long-lived proteins over\n\n[03:18] time.\n\n[03:19] And this is particularly important because approaches like drugs that are\n\n[03:26] targeting biological pathways, aren't going to have much of an impact on the\n\n[03:33] physical process.\n\n[03:35] Also, we pretty much know all the genes in the genome now, and we can say with\n\n[03:41] confidence that there are no genes encoded in our genome that recognize this\n\n[03:47] damage or that encode the machinery that can deal with this damage.\n\n[03:52] So genetic approaches and epigenetic approaches are not really going to have\n\n[03:57] much of an impact.\n\n[03:59] You might say, oh, there are, you know, for these extra cell or long-lived\n\n[04:03] proteins that accumulate this damage, there are things like collagenase.\n\n[04:08] It's known that collagenases stop working on these percains when they\n\n[04:14] accumulate damage.\n\n[04:15] So we're really left with nothing in the cell that can deal with this.\n\n[04:21] And we know that this damage that accumulates around and outside of cells\n\n[04:29] really has a big impact on the behavior of these cells in terms of whether\n\n[04:33] they're behaving like young cells or old cells.\n\n[04:36] So these are called heterochronic transplants, where you can take cells\n\n[04:40] from a young tissue and then transplant them in an old tissue or vice versa.\n\n[04:46] And what matters is that the cells are not going to be affected by the\n\n[04:50] damage, but what matters is, you know, the end tissue that the cells end up in.\n\n[04:55] So young cells in an old tissue behave like old cells, old cells in a young\n\n[05:01] tissue behave like young cells.\n\n[05:03] You know, we can kill ourselves trying to make these cells young again, which\n\n[05:07] I would argue most of the longevity field is still focused on.\n\n[05:11] And that's really not going to have much of an impact unless we deal with all\n\n[05:16] the extra cellular components as well.\n\n[05:19] The only way to do that at this point, or at least the most direct way is to do\n\n[05:27] tissue level or greater replacements, you know, organ level, tissue level,\n\n[05:31] whole replacements.\n\n[05:35] You know, replacements are already used in the clinic.\n\n[05:39] So there's not too much of a hurdle there.\n\n[05:41] They're used to reverse damage caused by trauma, for example, or to cure\n\n[05:47] certain diseases.\n\n[05:49] But of course, they could be used for a lot more if we're thinking about life\n\n[05:54] extension. And so I'll go over, you know, the different types of replacement\n\n[05:59] approaches, both for the body and the brain and the pros and cons.\n\n[06:03] And, you know, then this could potentially stimulate discussions about, you know,\n\n[06:11] some of the I probably missed some of the pros and cons or definitely open\n\n[06:16] to feedback on that.\n\n[06:18] But first, I just wanted to make a sort of a side by side comparison again with\n\n[06:22] much of the focus of the longevity field versus replacement.\n\n[06:27] And so what are the advantages of taking a replacement approach?\n\n[06:31] You know, a lot of us have heard that, oh, we have to understand aging before we\n\n[06:36] can address it. Maybe, but not if you're using replacement where you do, you\n\n[06:41] know, wholesale tissue replacement, all the damage is reversed at once and you\n\n[06:46] don't really have to understand, you know, that thousands of things that are going\n\n[06:50] wrong with aging to be able to reverse that aging biomarkers.\n\n[06:55] A similar idea. You know, you can find limitless, limitless numbers of things\n\n[07:01] that change with aging and call them biomarkers and say, you know, they're more\n\n[07:05] or less important.\n\n[07:07] But again, you don't really need that when you're doing tissue or greater level\n\n[07:11] replacements. Another aspect of the focus of the longevity field is to really get\n\n[07:18] the FDA to approve drugs as anti-aging drugs to get them on board with\n\n[07:24] longevity research.\n\n[07:26] And, you know, that's great.\n\n[07:28] The more people we get on board with longevity research, the more we get\n\n[07:32] government regulatory entities on board with the idea of life extension, the\n\n[07:38] better. But for replacement, we don't actually need that.\n\n[07:42] Replacements are generally approved.\n\n[07:45] We've seen recently in the news, for example, a woman just got, you know, two\n\n[07:51] pig organs transplanted at the same time, you know, kidney and thymus.\n\n[07:56] And previously, other individuals have gotten also a xeno, xeno transplants for\n\n[08:02] other organs.\n\n[08:04] And of course, tissue engineered organs have been used in the clinic.\n\n[08:08] And of course, a lot of donor to recipient organ transplants were in every body\n\n[08:15] part has been transplanted that way in people.\n\n[08:19] So the FDA is very much on board with these replacement strategies already, even\n\n[08:25] though right now they're for disease and trauma.\n\n[08:29] But in general, there's no restrictions there.\n\n[08:33] Also, you know, getting more scientists interested.\n\n[08:36] Again, that's very important.\n\n[08:37] Nothing wrong with that.\n\n[08:39] But in terms of replacement and this regenerative medicine approach, there's a\n\n[08:44] ton of talent out there.\n\n[08:46] It's one of the hottest areas of research in biology.\n\n[08:49] And it's right now there are certainly sufficient talent there.\n\n[08:54] It's just a matter of funding to hire them.\n\n[08:58] The costs of, you know, going about, you know, extending lifespan by targeting all\n\n[09:05] the different pathways involved and trying to modify them are indefinite at this point.\n\n[09:12] This is largely based on work done by the LBF, the recent LBF roadmap, where they\n\n[09:20] went out and talked to a lot of people about, you know, how much it would cost to\n\n[09:24] get to particular milestones and how long it would take.\n\n[09:28] And the cost is indeterminate because the timeline is indeterminate and there\n\n[09:33] would be lots that would need to be addressed.\n\n[09:37] In the case of replacement, you know, the milestones are very well defined for the\n\n[09:42] different approaches, which we'll go over again in a minute.\n\n[09:45] And so you can come up with cost estimates for that, which are, you know,\n\n[09:51] significant rate less.\n\n[09:53] Again, thank you to Leeav, Mark Hamelainen in particular for putting that together.\n\n[10:00] Yeah.\n\n[10:01] And then of course, you know, we don't even know with all these efforts.\n\n[10:04] And I would argue that the probability of success with these efforts is very low.\n\n[10:10] Whereas with replacement, we know if we succeed in doing it, that, you know, if\n\n[10:15] you have an old body and replace it with a young body, you will have reversed aging.\n\n[10:21] It's very high probability of success.\n\n[10:24] Okay.\n\n[10:25] So I don't know if there's any questions yet at this point.\n\n[10:30] No, you're good.\n\n[10:31] Good.\n\n[10:32] All right.\n\n[10:32] So let's start with replacement for the body.\n\n[10:37] And there are several possible options of how we can go about it.\n\n[10:42] In this case, there's biological, two broad categories, biological, non-biological.\n\n[10:48] And then within the biological, you can do full body replacement.\n\n[10:52] You can do all internal organs at once, or you can do more, you know, part by\n\n[10:58] part, organ by organ replacement as well.\n\n[11:01] So those are different approaches and we'll touch upon each of those.\n\n[11:06] Then a non-biological, similarly, you could do potentially, you know, full body\n\n[11:12] or all organs more part by part as well.\n\n[11:16] And, you know, there's efforts going on for all these approaches and, you know,\n\n[11:22] initial early proofs of concept that it can be done.\n\n[11:27] So whole body replacement, you know, it's conceptually the most straightforward.\n\n[11:33] I think it's also technically the most straightforward because it really\n\n[11:36] doesn't involve any new tech, or it doesn't exist, the tech has to be adapted to this.\n\n[11:44] But again, you know, the proof of concepts are there that the\n\n[11:47] technology could work for this.\n\n[11:49] But it would involve taking these primitive cells, germ cells, or other\n\n[11:54] primitive stem cells, and just growing brainless bodies.\n\n[11:59] Obviously we don't, wouldn't want, you know, this to be unethical in any way.\n\n[12:04] And so if there is no brain there and it's just a body, it should be okay to use.\n\n[12:10] And then, you know, he would use that to replace an old person's body with the young\n\n[12:15] bind. So basically you would do a body transplant.\n\n[12:20] So the head, the old head would be on a young bind.\n\n[12:24] The pros for this are everything except the brain is young at once.\n\n[12:30] You know, in one shot, there's potential for immune matching, depending on where\n\n[12:36] these cells come from that you're using to make the body.\n\n[12:40] And as I mentioned, it requires a little new tech, you know, proof of concept in\n\n[12:45] preclinical models has been done for all these steps.\n\n[12:50] The downsides are, you know, the social resistance.\n\n[12:54] People will hear this and go, oh my God, this is crazy.\n\n[12:58] And so I think that's a hurdle that needs to be addressed.\n\n[13:05] And you also need to deal with the severed spinal cord when you do a head or brain\n\n[13:10] transplant, although there to the technology is advanced or quite a bit to\n\n[13:15] either bypass the spinal cord severing, for example, using brain machine\n\n[13:21] interfaces, which are in clinical trials or biologically regrowing those\n\n[13:26] connections where a lot of progress has been made as well.\n\n[13:29] Our room cannot claim success on that yet.\n\n[13:33] And also scaling is our consideration here that is not necessarily the easiest to address.\n\n[13:41] So another approach that is being considered and explored is simply\n\n[13:47] replacing all internal organs at once.\n\n[13:51] It's actually not that complicated a surgery because there are not too many\n\n[13:56] tubes at the top and the bottom of all these organs.\n\n[14:00] So the surgery would appear to be doable, although that has not been tested yet.\n\n[14:06] And, but it is an approach.\n\n[14:08] The advantages in this case, instead of doing like the whole body transplant is\n\n[14:13] that there's no spinal cord severing and there's still possibility for immune\n\n[14:18] matching and also requires little new tech.\n\n[14:22] But here too, you know, the social acceptance of such an approach might\n\n[14:28] require, you know, a fair amount of, you know, convincing that this is great to be\n\n[14:34] saving lives and, and, and no one's getting hurt.\n\n[14:37] And, you know, that this is really the right thing to do.\n\n[14:41] But that is definitely, I think, something that would still need to be addressed.\n\n[14:45] In this case, not all body parts are replaced.\n\n[14:49] It's just the internal organs, which you could argue would likely have benefits on health.\n\n[14:56] But, you know, and I put this in the cons because it's not all body parts.\n\n[15:00] And I would worry though, because, you know, even like the limbs, for example, that are\n\n[15:06] aging over time, put you at risk of death as their blood vessels, you know, get old,\n\n[15:13] you're more likely to get clots, which can result in pulmonary embolisms and kill you,\n\n[15:19] for example.\n\n[15:20] You know, maybe it would extend a maximal lifespan, which would be great.\n\n[15:24] You know, not necessarily.\n\n[15:25] You still have to consider those other body parts.\n\n[15:28] Scaling again here too, is not something that is obvious, although, you know, there are\n\n[15:35] solutions.\n\n[15:36] So the other approach is to do more organ by organ or part by part.\n\n[15:41] And we've seen a lot of evidence of this in a clinic already, as I mentioned, you know,\n\n[15:47] recently, you know, transplants where you basically use normal developmental processes\n\n[15:55] to generate organs of the right size, which is why pinks are used.\n\n[16:00] And then if you can deal with the immune incompatibility, then you can use this for\n\n[16:07] transplantation.\n\n[16:08] So that's an approach that's getting a lot of attention now and is being used in certain\n\n[16:14] cases in clinical trials.\n\n[16:17] With, you know, certain amount of success, those organs are working in humans, but, you\n\n[16:24] know, still ways to go there in terms of reducing the immune rejection risk among other things.\n\n[16:32] And in this particular case with xenotransplantation, one of the downsides is, you know,\n\n[16:36] you're still using animals for this.\n\n[16:39] Although, again, there, there may be a way around it because, you know, in preclinical\n\n[16:46] studies, we do know how to make non-sentient bodies.\n\n[16:50] And so that could be a way of resolving that issue.\n\n[16:54] In any case, there's also other approaches like blastocyst complementation.\n\n[16:59] So in this case, you would be growing human organs in another species like the pig, again,\n\n[17:05] for size compatibility.\n\n[17:07] But in this case, the organs would be made of human cells.\n\n[17:12] And then, of course, there's what, you know, the field has been working on for quite some\n\n[17:17] time with fairly slow progress is tissue engineering.\n\n[17:22] And that's where you basically make de novo organs in the lab that can be used for\n\n[17:28] transplantation.\n\n[17:30] And there's been some success, you know, like the bladder that's already probably a couple\n\n[17:35] of decades ago or at least a decade and a half.\n\n[17:38] And, you know, those are functioning in humans quite well.\n\n[17:42] And so that's a success.\n\n[17:44] But those have been far and few in between.\n\n[17:47] And I think the advantage of these other approaches like the xenotransplantation or growing\n\n[17:54] in human organs in the pig, for example, is that they don't require really other than\n\n[18:02] genetic engineering for the immune compatibility.\n\n[18:04] They don't require tissue engineering because it's really letting nature or the developmental\n\n[18:11] process occur on its own as it normally does.\n\n[18:16] And I think that's a concept that is really going to take over her replacement field over\n\n[18:23] time is just using normal developmental processes to generate the tissues, the organs, the\n\n[18:31] organs that we want for replacement.\n\n[18:34] Because we don't, again, have to understand all the steps or, you know, we don't have to\n\n[18:39] be able to de novo make things from scratch.\n\n[18:43] They will just grow and develop naturally as they normally would, you know, when we were\n\n[18:47] a piece is growing up and becoming kids and growing up into adults.\n\n[18:53] Yeah.\n\n[18:54] In this case, the advantages, again, no spinal cord severing scaling could be easier.\n\n[19:00] Again, depends on which of these approaches you're taking.\n\n[19:05] And in all cases, it's already happening.\n\n[19:08] So, there's early proof of concept that this can work.\n\n[19:12] The downsides, if you're going to do it this way, it means a lot of surgeries, which,\n\n[19:20] you know, again, puts you at greater risk of complications.\n\n[19:24] And it's hard to replace all body parts this way, although conceivable and you could.\n\n[19:30] And the immune mismatching, again, that can be different depending on the approaches here.\n\n[19:36] But, you know, it is a challenge with these using these different parts.\n\n[19:43] All right.\n\n[19:45] So, there's also a non-biological approach to replacement where you can do replace, like,\n\n[19:52] all the organs of the body with synthetic replacements.\n\n[19:56] And, you know, I only know one lab who's doing this, but they seem to be doing quite well.\n\n[20:04] This is, you know, the BrainX from Narzostanzla, but, you know, and so they have this completely\n\n[20:13] synthetic artificial system that replaces the need for all our organs.\n\n[20:19] And, you know, of course, because this is engineered, it could also easily be\n\n[20:23] replaced when it gets old or the parts can be maintained much more like an old car\n\n[20:29] where you can keep it going indefinitely if you change all the parts.\n\n[20:33] So, this is an interesting approach that, you know, I'm keeping an eye on.\n\n[20:38] We should all keep an eye on.\n\n[20:39] The advantages are easy scaling and there's opportunities here for\n\n[20:44] brain machine interfaces to combine that with controlling limbs, for example.\n\n[20:51] I think that's an advantage.\n\n[20:52] I also put it in the disadvantages because brain machine interfaces are required in this case to,\n\n[20:59] you know, be able to interact with the outside world.\n\n[21:02] And so, the state of the art for these brain machine interfaces are getting pretty good\n\n[21:09] for the machine reading your intentions and being able to control limbs, whether they're\n\n[21:16] artificial or your own limbs, if you're paralyzed, for example.\n\n[21:20] So, they're getting pretty good at that, or they are pretty good at that already.\n\n[21:24] But there's very little in the way of sensory input to the brain using machine interfaces.\n\n[21:33] And so, that's an area I think where before this can be useful, that would need to be addressed.\n\n[21:40] And then, you know, potentially, you still have to worry about the unbarricaded parts\n\n[21:45] that are biological that you haven't replaced.\n\n[21:49] But, you know, that could potentially be addressed, again, using synthetic body parts\n\n[21:56] like synthetic limbs, for example, which become very sophisticated and perform, you know,\n\n[22:02] almost as well or maybe in some cases better than our natural limbs, certainly better than\n\n[22:09] our natural limbs as we get old.\n\n[22:12] So, that's also an approach that I think is of interest.\n\n[22:15] And of course, there is a fully artificial heart that's being used now in people.\n\n[22:22] There's also kidney-like bioreactors that are in preclinical state, parts are working pretty well.\n\n[22:30] And other organs potentially also follow suit.\n\n[22:34] So, you can do this also, this replacement with synthetics,\n\n[22:38] either part by part or the whole thing.\n\n[22:43] And, you know, the brain remains biological, maybe other parts of the body would be biological as\n\n[22:49] well if you were doing this in combination with biological replacements.\n\n[22:54] So, there's a bio-machine, you know, the compatibility is not always perfect.\n\n[23:01] And so, there's a risk there.\n\n[23:05] I think the technology can stand to improve a little bit.\n\n[23:08] It's gotten pretty good with blood vessels, which are really important because, you know,\n\n[23:12] if the biological vessel detaches from the synthetic one, it can be pretty disastrous.\n\n[23:18] But I think a lot of progress has been made there.\n\n[23:20] But, you know, overall, again, still some progress to be made.\n\n[23:24] So, that's the body replacement approaches.\n\n[23:28] I'm going to move to the brain, but unless anybody has questions in the meantime.\n\n[23:33] There's no question.\n\n[23:34] There's one, but I think we can move on and then we'll take them back.\n\n[23:37] One by one.\n\n[23:38] Okay.\n\n[23:39] Okay.\n\n[23:39] Great.\n\n[23:41] So, brain tissue replacement.\n\n[23:43] Obviously, we can't replace the whole brain at once.\n\n[23:46] It would be a different person.\n\n[23:48] So, we have to consider how we do this.\n\n[23:50] And the only way would be progressive tissue replacement.\n\n[23:55] And again, in the, you know, in terms of FDA approval in the clinic, this doesn't seem to be\n\n[24:02] a problem using cells or we don't call them tissues yet, but there are combinations of,\n\n[24:09] you know, scaffolds and cells that are being used.\n\n[24:12] So, you call them very primitive tissues that are used in people already.\n\n[24:16] So, you know, there's no roadblock there in terms of getting it to the clinic.\n\n[24:20] Here are some successes in terms of treating Parkinson's and epilepsy with our new cells.\n\n[24:27] These companies like Aspen, Neuroscience, Blue Rock, Neurona.\n\n[24:34] Aspen not yet.\n\n[24:35] They have FDA approval, but everybody knows, anticipates that their cells are going to be\n\n[24:40] as good as Blue Rock's without the need for immune suppression because they're autologous.\n\n[24:47] But these companies have shown safety in the clinic and efficacy of their cells in these brain\n\n[24:54] transplants. And, you know, they're also commercially very viable successes.\n\n[25:00] So, the companies are worth a lot at this point.\n\n[25:03] Again, because it works, their cells work to reverse, you know, these are in the case\n\n[25:08] of Parkinson's, atrial disease. And then, of course, in the case of epilepsy,\n\n[25:13] just their neurological disease. That's just to say that, you know, that there's a path to\n\n[25:20] getting this implemented in the clinic. But there's two reasons why progressive brain tissue\n\n[25:27] replacement makes sense. One is that it appears that we'll be able to add new tissue to the brains\n\n[25:36] and have it functionally integrate with the existing brain. This was shown most nicely,\n\n[25:45] you know, already eight years ago in Germany by Magda Wiener-Gurtz's lab showing that\n\n[25:50] transplanted embryonic precursors differentiate into neurons that integrate remarkably well\n\n[25:57] with the adult neural circuitry. So, very promising result there. And then this was repeated\n\n[26:04] and continues to be repeated by a bunch of different labs, including ours, just showing that,\n\n[26:10] you know, you can get really good integration of new neurons in the brain. Whether you're\n\n[26:16] transplanting the associated cells or organoids, they all seem to do quite well.\n\n[26:24] Yeah, I just have some examples here and they all basically say the same thing,\n\n[26:29] that the neurons integrate really well. However, we're not there yet in terms of those neurons\n\n[26:36] truly being functional because there's things missing. So, these are typically a single neuronal\n\n[26:44] type or at least a single neuronal class, a single class of neurons, for example,\n\n[26:50] excitatory neurons and not inhibitory neurons. And so, we know that without the full complement\n\n[26:57] of neuronal subtypes, that tissue or that graft cannot process information normally.\n\n[27:04] It also lacks structure. So, we know the structure is really important for the wiring within the\n\n[27:10] tissue or in this case, within the graft. And so, the cells are all mixed up, which they are in all\n\n[27:16] these applications, including in the work read down and published. You're not going to get\n\n[27:21] information processing that's useful to the host. We still have work to do. But again, this is,\n\n[27:29] you know, doesn't require development of new technologies. It just requires doing things right.\n\n[27:36] But so, this shows at least in principle that we can add, should be able to add new tissue\n\n[27:42] to the old brain and have it functionally integrate. But important to progressive tissue\n\n[27:47] replacement is not just the addition of new tissue, but the removal of old tissue, which\n\n[27:53] inevitably lead to strokes and other bad things. So, we need to get rid of that tissue.\n\n[27:59] And we already have a proof of concept in the clinic that oral tissue can be removed without\n\n[28:09] loss of its information content or interruption of function or personality or self-identity\n\n[28:17] in cases slow growing benign gliomas that occur in people of any age, but typically more so as\n\n[28:25] you get older. So, even in patients in their 70s, for example, they get these tumors that\n\n[28:30] grow from a pinpoint out and eat away a certain area of the brain or the neoportex in particular.\n\n[28:39] And let's say it eats away at the language center over the course of an extended period of time.\n\n[28:46] Those individuals don't lose the ability to speak because language gets re-encoded in a\n\n[28:51] different part of the neoportex because of the progressive nature of the construction of the\n\n[28:57] tissue and because the person is using language every day. If you have a stroke in the language\n\n[29:03] center, it's a catastrophic event. There's no time for the relocation or the plasticity to occur\n\n[29:10] and you lose language. But these tumors show that you can, you know, lose tissue slowly over time\n\n[29:17] without losing the information content in it, without you even realizing that it's happening.\n\n[29:23] So, this is the other half of the equation. We can add tissue and we can progressively remove\n\n[29:30] tissue without loss of information content. So, great. You know, how might we go about doing this?\n\n[29:37] There are different here too, just like for the body, for the brain, there are different approaches.\n\n[29:43] There's an engineering approach where, again, you're in all cases inspired by the normal\n\n[29:50] developmental process. So, you want to recapitulate that normal developmental process.\n\n[29:56] And this is something that my group is working on, engineering a fetal-like neocortical tissue,\n\n[30:05] which is very well defined after you're in, you know, extensive omics analysis to know what\n\n[30:11] precursor cell types are present there, what are the extracellular signals and scaffolding\n\n[30:17] components that are necessary for those cells to develop into a well-structured, mature tissue\n\n[30:25] that can process information normally. So, we've done this analysis, we can generate all the\n\n[30:31] components. Sorry, this is a bit of a plug for the work we're doing, but it's only a couple of slides.\n\n[30:39] And so, we've actually generated a proto tissue now, you know, has the structure and the precursor\n\n[30:45] cell types that we want, and we've started testing this in animals. Again, still a lot of work to do,\n\n[30:52] but, you know, we think it's possible to engineer this fetal-like tissue to give rise to structured,\n\n[30:59] functional adult tissue. It's not the only approach though, although it does have advantages in terms\n\n[31:06] of surgical implementation, because since we're designing the tissue, we can design the shape\n\n[31:11] and adjust it to each lesion site, for example, and it's much easier to scale than the approaches\n\n[31:20] I'm going to tell you about now. The disadvantage is it's harder to get it right, because compared\n\n[31:27] to the advantages I'm going to show you now as well, and those approaches are basically to use\n\n[31:35] normal development to obtain the same precursor tissue, in this case not engineered, but derived\n\n[31:41] from earlier developmental stages. So, you may have heard of these ex-utero synthetic fetuses\n\n[31:48] that different groups are working on. So, they start with human pluripotent stem cells in culture,\n\n[31:54] which, you know, standard practice now in terms of deriving those from individuals,\n\n[31:59] and then developing them into these sort of early fetuses. And the big advantage here is that those\n\n[32:08] tissues are more likely to be authentic. This is also scalable, which is nice. The disadvantage\n\n[32:16] is the need potentially for synthetic uteri to get to older stages where we can actually collect\n\n[32:25] this fetal-like tissue for our grafts instead of engineering it, for example,\n\n[32:30] and that hasn't been developed yet. Otherwise, you know, it may be hard to get these\n\n[32:38] synthetic fetuses to develop to a stage that's old enough that we could collect tissue without\n\n[32:45] necrosis setting in. You know, people are working on it and they're smart people and hopefully\n\n[32:51] they'll succeed here. Another way is to use interspecies chimeras. There were two papers that\n\n[32:58] just came out this month showing that you could grow, I think there was some rat cells in mice\n\n[33:05] and get, in both cases, it's not complete. So, it's not clean. I think there's ways that you\n\n[33:11] could make this a lot cleaner. But in red here is a rat brain tissue in an otherwise mouse brain.\n\n[33:19] And in another study, they show a similar thing, although the degree of chimeras in a way is worse.\n\n[33:26] I think this could be improved and you could imagine growing human fetal tissue, brain tissue\n\n[33:36] in another species to obtain a source for transplantation and repair.\n\n[33:42] And then you could use human fetal tissue itself. You know, this has been used for quite some time,\n\n[33:49] you know, for Parkinson's, for example, in 1987, 88, and then ever since, human fetal brain tissue\n\n[33:58] has been used to treat Parkinson's in particular. And, you know, one could imagine but using human\n\n[34:05] fetal tissue could be a source or tissue for transplantation. Disadvantage, you know, there is\n\n[34:11] some social opposition to using human fetal tissue, even though at this point, you know, there are not\n\n[34:17] even any functional neurons there. So, it's really not, you know, there's no sentience. And the\n\n[34:23] scaling is also, you know, problematic. But in any case, that's an alternative approach where we know\n\n[34:30] the tissue is truly authentic. So, I think that's pretty much it. For the brain, this is just a\n\n[34:35] cartoon showing how, you know, the addition and removal of all tissue could be implemented.\n\n[34:42] We have ways, although they haven't been adapted to our purposes yet, but we have ways of\n\n[34:48] progressively silencing brain tissue from a pinpoint out that would mimic a artificial\n\n[34:56] glioma because we wouldn't want to use the glioma to silence tissue as an example, I'm sure, of your\n\n[35:02] earlier. But we have ways of doing that. So, you could progressively silence parts of the brain\n\n[35:08] while putting in your fetal tissue in other areas and allowing progressive silencing and tissue\n\n[35:17] development and integration occur coincidentally and repeating this a few times. So, that's a\n\n[35:24] way of doing that. I went over that fast, you know, happy to go over it in more detail.\n\n[35:31] It's very interesting. But the point is, you know, none of this seems, requires new technologies.\n\n[35:41] It's all adaptation of existing technologies. I think it's all achievable and combined with,\n\n[35:49] you know, body part replacements or body replacements, you know, we could beat aging\n\n[35:56] in a reasonable amount of time and with a reasonable budget that isn't crazy. So,\n\n[36:04] anyway, open to feedback and questions, Arcus one.\n\n[36:09] Fantastic. Thank you so very much. That was really interesting. And I love that. I think in your\n\n[36:15] previous talk that you gave it for us, that was mostly really focused on the brain. And now, I\n\n[36:17] think, you know, going through the whole path of the whole body first, I think they did a really\n\n[36:20] great vision out for that. There's a ton of questions already. So, I'm going to keep mine\n\n[36:24] very brief, aka, I'm going to ask them at the end in case we have time. But for now, we have\n\n[36:29] Fiona, why don't you kick us off? All right. Thank you, Alison. And John, thank you so much.\n\n[36:35] This is fascinating as always. My question is about the brain. I think it's very interesting.\n\n[36:42] My question is about the brain replacement, right? Somewhere I read that a brain that doesn't evolve\n\n[36:48] or grow up with a body where it maps how to control, let's say, fingers, limbs, and all that,\n\n[36:56] that if it's placed in another body, it will not know on the lower levels of the brain function\n\n[37:04] what to do and that the organism will die. Also, I understand there are neurons outside the brain\n\n[37:12] in the heart and in the stomach. And, you know, do these have memories that build up over a lifetime?\n\n[37:18] Can you address that? Yeah, I don't. There are certainly no conscious memories there. You know,\n\n[37:25] I like to use quadriplegics as an example. You know, it's they don't after, you know,\n\n[37:32] after their accident, for example, they don't lose certain memories that that would be in the neurons\n\n[37:40] that are in the rest of the body, for example, right? So, they're still the same person,\n\n[37:46] you know, they may be a little bit depressed for a while about their new condition of the\n\n[37:52] paralyzed, but essentially it's the same person and they're not connected to any of the neurons\n\n[37:59] in the rest of their body. So, in their digestive system, their sensory neurons, motor neurons,\n\n[38:06] you know, all the different types of neurons that occur in the body. So, I don't think those\n\n[38:11] neurons really contribute to who we are in terms of our personality or at least not directly who\n\n[38:18] we are in terms of our personality or self-identity. Yeah, the other question was, yeah, the connection,\n\n[38:26] again, yeah, so it's the same thing. You know, you can be disconnected neuronally from your body and\n\n[38:32] your brain doesn't die. And during development, yeah, the process is coincident with body growth\n\n[38:39] and those neurons connecting to the body. But, you know, my understanding of the physiology of\n\n[38:48] the neoporters is that it is super plastic and you can, for example, if you get a new limb,\n\n[38:55] your, that you can somehow communicate with your brain, you can, you incorporate that new limb as\n\n[39:03] yours. So, if there's so much plasticity in the neocortex, it won't know the difference whether,\n\n[39:10] you know, if you get a synthetic limb, you know, because you lost a limb and you get a synthetic\n\n[39:16] limb. If there's some proprioceptive feedback from that artificial limb, your brain, your cortex,\n\n[39:24] will adapt it as if it's your limb. So, I think there's enough plasticity there to, you know,\n\n[39:31] connect with the world normally. All right, thanks. Aaron. Hey, this is nitpicky,\n\n[39:38] but I feel like it's justified. So, the slide that you had for your arguments about what,\n\n[39:43] why the replacement should be done over other things for understanding aging and for biomarkers,\n\n[39:50] if we don't know how maintenance occurs for these replaced portions, at least at the tissue level,\n\n[39:57] then your same argument about a cell being in a bad environment leads it to being an old cell\n\n[40:02] still applies to tissues. So, if we don't understand how maintenance occurs, then tissue level\n\n[40:07] replacement, it might be that you replace the tissue and it fails within months because\n\n[40:12] the maintenance systems were turned off. The logic that you outlined is all correct for whole body\n\n[40:18] replacement if you grow like a whole entirely new body, but for tissue level replacement,\n\n[40:23] which is the title that you used on that slide, I don't think it's correct. So, if you can update\n\n[40:28] that portion, that'd be good. Yeah, I did not say just tissue level or tissue or greater level.\n\n[40:34] I can't remember. Sometimes I use both, but yeah. So, I'm trying to be all inclusive about the\n\n[40:39] different approaches, but yeah, it's a good point, right? That if you have, and certainly if, you\n\n[40:45] know, if you have a single organ, a young organ transplanted in an old person, it's unlikely to\n\n[40:54] do much good, right? Because failure of any other organ is going to kill not only that organ, but\n\n[41:00] the whole person. The effect of the surrounding environment though to cells, I think it's something\n\n[41:07] yeah, you could explore biomarkers, could be useful for that for sure. You know, the evidence\n\n[41:14] even in the brain in humans over time is actually pretty good that the environment doesn't, you know,\n\n[41:24] hurt the new cells in that case that much. And if we're talking about tissue level replacements,\n\n[41:31] it should even be a lot less because the cells in the new tissue will be much more buffered from\n\n[41:37] the rest of the environment because they're surrounded by the young tissue. But in the cases\n\n[41:43] that I'm referring to again from back in the 80s when they were using fetal human brain tissue\n\n[41:50] to treat Parkinson's, they did post-mortem analysis of these, you know, up to two decades later.\n\n[41:57] And even though those were naked cells in a diseased environment, you know, accelerated,\n\n[42:04] degenerative environment, after 16 years they still look pretty good and were still functioning.\n\n[42:13] And then after, you know, over two decades they were starting to show signs of pathology,\n\n[42:20] you know. And again, those are naked cells in the diseased environments\n\n[42:24] and they were still, they still lasted, you know, close to a couple of decades.\n\n[42:29] You know, I think we can be relatively confident that the environment does matter of course,\n\n[42:35] like we mentioned because you do need to replace everything eventually and probably in a recent\n\n[42:42] amount of time. But I think, you know, I think there's pretty good evidence and yes,\n\n[42:48] it could be confirmed with biomarkers that the tissue, young tissue is doing pretty well in an\n\n[42:55] old environment. But we have a collaboration with Radin Vlaya where we started to work at this.\n\n[43:01] And yeah, you know, obviously that's, he works on biomarkers,\n\n[43:05] a big generic biomarkers and so I think it can still be useful. I would still argue that I don't\n\n[43:11] think they're necessary though, but yeah. The next one we have John.\n\n[43:16] Hi John, nice presentation. I particularly like the way you outline the importance of\n\n[43:21] extracellular aging as contrasted with cellular aging. I'd like to suggest a couple of alternative\n\n[43:30] approaches that might run in parallel with your whole body or whatever replacement.\n\n[43:36] One is to genetically engineer fibroblasts and fibroblasts like cells so that they would go\n\n[43:45] through more quickly and replace aging collagen, aging elastin and so forth. Right now they do it,\n\n[43:52] but they take around seven or eight years in most tissues to replace the collagen and if we could\n\n[44:00] speed that up, that could be very therapeutic. The other is drug alternatives to breaking\n\n[44:07] cross-links, glycation cross-links. There's one drug that was developed 25 years ago,\n\n[44:15] Algaebrium or ALT 711 and that works on one kind of principal cross-linked B-alpha diketone.\n\n[44:23] There's another principal cross-linked glucose pain, which so far we don't have a small molecule\n\n[44:28] that can attack that. So I wanted to suggest that we expand your project to include some parallel\n\n[44:36] projects. Yeah, I'll start with the second question first. Yeah, that is a molecular approach.\n\n[44:41] I wouldn't say it's impossible. I just think it's very difficult because of the complexity of the\n\n[44:48] damage. You know, there may be a couple of examples of drugs that can reverse cross-links, but\n\n[44:55] you know, I'd be very surprised if they had no side effects because it's very hard for a drug to\n\n[45:00] distinguish a very similar covalent bond in a bad protein versus a good protein.\n\n[45:11] In the case of alpha diketone, they don't exist inside the cell and they don't have any\n\n[45:19] particular beneficial purpose. So breaking the alpha diketone links could be done without\n\n[45:27] side effects. I've been taking Algaebrium for 24 years now, so I'm pretty sure it's pretty safe.\n\n[45:34] From your initial slide, of course, you showed that another problem is just breaking the elastin\n\n[45:41] and breaking into the strands and that couldn't be fixed by Algaebrium, but it might be fixed if\n\n[45:46] we can get a new kind of fibroblast that will chew up the old extracellular matrix and lay down\n\n[45:56] new extracellular matrix in its wake. Yeah, and to your first point, I think that makes sense if\n\n[46:03] it's something that doesn't exist normally, for sure, but there are so many other modifications\n\n[46:12] that occur over time. Breaks, like you mentioned, but not only breaks, there's aggregates, there's\n\n[46:18] lipid crosslinking, there's carbohydrate crosslinking, protein buslinking,\n\n[46:23] are different types. There's calcification, there's, you know, maybe you can imagine drugs\n\n[46:30] for all of these, but again, because of the stochastic nature, I think it would be very difficult.\n\n[46:37] I agree 100%. I do think that it's important to work on this parallel at\n\n[46:44] along with your project. Sure, sure. The other question with the fibroblast, engineer fibroblast,\n\n[46:52] some collagens turn over pretty, they're like, collagens are a big family, right? They're the\n\n[46:57] most abundant proteins, you know, if you put them all together in our bodies, but there are a lot\n\n[47:02] of different types of collagen. Some of them will turn over relatively fast, some very slowly,\n\n[47:08] and some almost not at all. But in the cases studied, whenever they started accumulating\n\n[47:15] damage, they're no longer turned over by collagenases. So I'm not sure how putting in\n\n[47:22] new fibroblasts is going to help that. They have the same collagenases to all fibroblasts.\n\n[47:27] I believe that the fibroblasts will actually chew up the old collagen, not just secreted\n\n[47:33] collagens. That's my understanding. Yeah, I don't know how aggresive they are. Typically, it's more,\n\n[47:42] you know, immune derived cells that do the bulk of that, people warn their spibrosis. They certainly\n\n[47:49] sound me alarm, fibroblasts become senescent, warns damage. But yeah, there might be something\n\n[47:56] there I'm not familiar with that. There we are. Fibroblasts, you know, PCM.\n\n[48:03] We only have one minute and I really want to make sure that we also get your final words on what it\n\n[48:16] is that you're doing right now, Jean, and how people can help and support you if they're interested\n\n[48:20] in doing so. Because you showed a few slides about the company, but it would be useful to have some\n\n[48:25] kind of clear action items for people to take away with. That would be great.\n\n[48:29] Yeah. Sorry, Micah. I saw you had your hand up. I would have loved to hear your question because\n\n[48:34] you always have good questions. But maybe you can hit me later. Yeah, I think, you know,\n\n[48:41] just being here discussing this is a positive thing. I'm happy to see that.\n\n[48:50] You know, we're looking for people who want to get involved with these replacement approaches.\n\n[48:55] You know, there's a lot of work to be done with progressive tissue replacement in the brains or\n\n[48:59] anybody interested in that, please reach out to me, see if we can work together. That would be great.\n\n[49:06] But yeah, that's it. Thanks for having me. All right. Great. I'm hoping that we hear a lot\n\n[49:12] more as you guys are gradually building out things and please do get in touch with Jean. I think his\n\n[49:17] work is like absolutely fantastic. You've made so much progress in such a short time. I think there's\n\n[49:21] so much to do as you laid out in the different categories. But I really think that you're moving\n\n[49:26] really fast and it would be great if more people can like jump on and support this type of work.\n\n[49:31] Thank you so much. Thanks everyone for your amazing questions. I shared your Twitter here\n\n[49:35] that people can contact you through, but you also shared your email address, I think in the final\n\n[49:38] slide or in the first slide so that people definitely know how to contact you. If you have\n\n[49:42] trouble contacting Jean, contact me to contact Jean. And yeah, I'm really excited for what you\n\n[49:46] guys are building. And I think that could hardly be enough support, I think for this type of stuff\n\n[49:51] right now. We need to move fast. Thanks a lot."

        "transcription": "[00:00] They say two heads are better than one, so what about two billion?\n\n[00:15] Today's topic is Hiveminds and Networked Intelligence, and I should start by saying\n\n[00:20] they are not entirely the same thing.\n\n[00:22] Indeed, while Hiveminds is mostly a subcategory of networked intelligence, it has a lot of\n\n[00:27] subcategories of its own too.\n\n[00:30] Probably the best known example of a Hivemind from fiction is the Borg from Star Trek, and\n\n[00:35] those fellows are sufficiently horrifying that it gives Hiveminds a pretty bad reputation.\n\n[00:41] To be fair though, they are rarely presented in a positive light in fiction.\n\n[00:46] We'll try to look at some positive aspects and examples today, but to be honest I think\n\n[00:51] I'd rather jump off a cliff than be part of most versions of them so I'm probably\n\n[00:55] not a neutral spokesman.\n\n[00:57] Networked Intelligence is another story, as a broad category, and networked intelligence\n\n[01:02] itself is one of the three types of intelligence and possible paths to superintelligence we've\n\n[01:08] discussed.\n\n[01:09] One of the others is speed intelligence, when the mind is the same except sped up.\n\n[01:14] That is simple enough and we've talked about it extensively in other episodes.\n\n[01:18] Networked Intelligence and quality intelligence, which is rather hard to define beyond the\n\n[01:22] difference between a lone genius who solves a problem a roomful of experts could not,\n\n[01:27] are both types we've spent less time on and today we'll fix that for the former.\n\n[01:32] The first key thing though about networked intelligence is that it's already something\n\n[01:35] we have, and I don't mean in the way humans themselves are arguably a colony organism\n\n[01:41] composed of many different types of cells and organs.\n\n[01:44] Unlike the most integrated forms of Hivemind, you are not a bigger intelligence composed\n\n[01:48] of smaller intelligences so I think we have to exclude individual humans as an example\n\n[01:53] of a Hivemind.\n\n[01:55] Community and networked intelligence is a bit tricky, in order to avoid trivial examples\n\n[01:59] like a herd of animals with limited communication.\n\n[02:03] Normally with futuristic concepts I always encourage folks to avoid definitions that\n\n[02:07] would include ourselves since that tends to indicate the definition is bad.\n\n[02:12] You and I are not cyborgs, it's nice to point out how things like our glasses or tooth\n\n[02:17] fillings or similar can be argued to be a mechanical augmentation of a human, but it's\n\n[02:22] really not what we mean by cyborg so you probably have a bad definition if it includes modern\n\n[02:27] humans.\n\n[02:28] Similarly, humans are not what we mean when we say networked intelligence or Hivemind,\n\n[02:32] but human civilization was built by us becoming a simple networked intelligence.\n\n[02:37] Moreover, we recognize such things exist and it's implicit whenever we refer to a group\n\n[02:42] or organization that are beyond classic family and genetic groupings.\n\n[02:47] This company, that sports team, that church or village or city or country, we do regard\n\n[02:52] as an entity in its own right.\n\n[02:54] A network being a bunch of ropes tied together to create a net, usually with nodes or knots,\n\n[02:59] it's probably not too surprising the definition of network is pretty hazy too.\n\n[03:04] But for today's context we'll say the simplest thinking network would be several\n\n[03:08] individual nodes, human minds in this case, connected together exchanging information.\n\n[03:14] Already we've been doing this since before there were humans, since even the most basic\n\n[03:19] of body language and noises inside some pack of animals is an intentional exchange of information.\n\n[03:25] If you want to stretch the point, you can argue that even two simple organisms exchanging\n\n[03:29] DNA to make a new one is pretty sophisticated communication, and you can really stretch\n\n[03:34] the point and include even a simple unicellular organism that reproduces by mitosis, by dividing\n\n[03:39] itself, arguing it is a giant factory or many interdependent machines.\n\n[03:44] It's easy to forget just how complex such bacteria are, but it is better to think of\n\n[03:48] them as giant metropolises full of molecules as people and buildings than some tiny simple\n\n[03:54] organism barely bigger than an atom, after all, each cell usually contains trillions\n\n[03:59] of atoms.\n\n[04:00] Like I said though, we have to beware definitions of new concepts so broad as to be meaningless,\n\n[04:06] not because it is inaccurate, just inconvenient and not helpful.\n\n[04:10] I will just place the simplest of networked intelligences at the invention of language,\n\n[04:15] as that seriously jumped up both the bandwidth and integrity of those signals and as a byproduct\n\n[04:20] allowed far more short term and focused specialization.\n\n[04:24] We see limited specialization in almost any group of cooperating animals, and we see intense\n\n[04:29] specialization in things like insect hives, but the sheer amount of fast and accurate\n\n[04:35] data that can be exchanged through human language allows us to train people with identical\n\n[04:40] DNA to perform very specific tasks not strongly shaped by their biology, and we see that\n\n[04:45] strongly with the emergence of cities, from which we get the word civilization in the\n\n[04:50] first place.\n\n[04:51] Very many people each specialized in very different tasks which could not possibly allow\n\n[04:56] their survival in isolation just doing that specialized task, all grouped together for\n\n[05:01] fast exchange of information and supplies.\n\n[05:04] Any definition being a bit arbitrary, I will set this as the simplest example of networked\n\n[05:09] intelligence for humans.\n\n[05:11] It also represents a huge paradigm shift and increase in resources and abilities.\n\n[05:17] Same as basic communication and tool use made humans jump up over other animals, the rise\n\n[05:21] of cities and civilizations gave a huge edge.\n\n[05:25] We have tons of technological improvements that make individual people more effective,\n\n[05:29] we've had many more that just let us increase how many people we can have alive and healthy,\n\n[05:34] our carrying capacity.\n\n[05:37] However many of these inventions were such boons because they improved the network.\n\n[05:42] Roads and bridges to connect rural areas to cities and cities to other cities, carrying\n\n[05:46] not just food and supplies but allowing the movement of people, ideas, and information.\n\n[05:51] Ships, railroads, highways, postal systems, radios, telephones, and these days the internet,\n\n[05:58] all can be viewed as an amplification and augmentation of basic human speech, which\n\n[06:03] allowed two people fairly near each other to exchange complex concepts quickly and accurately.\n\n[06:10] Even the invention of writing, which allowed communication not only over distance but over\n\n[06:14] time itself, improved this basic human network so that it could include dead people.\n\n[06:20] Long after they were gone, even from memories of the next generation or two who met them\n\n[06:24] and spoke to them, writing allowed us to incorporate non-living humans into the human network and\n\n[06:30] the modern internet has allowed us to include computers and databases into that network\n\n[06:34] too.\n\n[06:35] We don't really think of ourselves as networked intelligence, some actual entity called humanity,\n\n[06:41] but even just those of us old enough to remember when the internet did not exist, and even\n\n[06:46] being exposed to it gradually so it lacked an explosive moment of transition, can see\n\n[06:51] a clear difference in the civilization we have now as opposed to then.\n\n[06:56] Technological changes happen so fast and frequently these days that we are a bit immune to seeing\n\n[07:00] how they changed us, but it has still happened.\n\n[07:04] I wanted to note that though because a bit like cybernetics, networked intelligence is\n\n[07:08] one of those things where it happens gradually enough that we might just keep moving the\n\n[07:13] bar.\n\n[07:14] Folks a few centuries from now might be shot through with tons of devices, cloud-storing\n\n[07:18] memories outside their head and routinely talk to people by just thinking their direction\n\n[07:22] with the technological equivalent of telepathy, and still be talking about how in the future\n\n[07:27] people might be cyborgs or network their minds together, not like us of course.\n\n[07:33] But no matter how integrated human minds might get to be, the human itself is not the networked\n\n[07:38] intelligence, it's just a note of it, whether it's an individual or not.\n\n[07:43] Bob is not the networked intelligence of New York City, he's just a component of it.\n\n[07:48] On this subject of networks and hive minds, we are obviously very interested in what happens\n\n[07:53] to the individual, if they still continue to exist or not, or are free or not, or have\n\n[07:58] privacy or not, but the individual is not the network, even if it is a key or irreplaceable\n\n[08:05] component.\n\n[08:06] Who is the network?\n\n[08:08] The network is the network.\n\n[08:10] We have a thought problem that's fairly interesting for developing this notion.\n\n[08:13] We've talked a lot about copying a human mind onto a computer substrate where the processors\n\n[08:19] emulate neurons.\n\n[08:20] That's an intuitive enough concept for folks, but you can just as easily, well not easily,\n\n[08:26] sit millions of people down with pencil and paper and have them perform all those same\n\n[08:30] calculations that a computer is doing, storing each result on paper and walking over to hand\n\n[08:35] each new bit to another calculator.\n\n[08:38] We can envision your neurons doing this to make you, we can envision computer chips doing\n\n[08:43] this to make you, but there is something passing strange about the idea of a ton of people\n\n[08:48] cracking all the calculations out manually, including folks looking at the scenery and\n\n[08:53] jotting down data to be sent to a giant skyscraper full of cubicles manned by the team that makes\n\n[08:59] up your eyes and optic nerve.\n\n[09:01] Yet by the same logic as the neurons or the computer emulation, that would be you, and\n\n[09:07] in this case you would be a networked intelligence, all those people are your nodes.\n\n[09:12] You don't, as with the traditional hive mind, have access to their thoughts, you can't\n\n[09:17] control them, they are not indeed wired into your mind at all.\n\n[09:21] We could also replace them with a giant ant colony, a literal hive, that wasn't calculating\n\n[09:27] but performed those operations far more stupidly and simply, pushing colored or scented grains\n\n[09:32] around to serve as your bits and signals.\n\n[09:35] I like this example, where people or ants, our usual example of a hive mind, are cracking\n\n[09:40] out calculations to run your mind because it both shakes up the notion of thinking of\n\n[09:44] an uploaded mind on a computer as essentially just a substitute brain, a black box doing\n\n[09:49] the work, and highlights that such a thing doesn't actually have to be composed of\n\n[09:54] the actual minds of its nodes in an intrusive manner.\n\n[09:58] I think it is also easier to picture some place like New York City or Tokyo as a potential\n\n[10:02] real separate entity with thoughts when you've just tried to wrap your head around a million\n\n[10:07] people with pencil and paper running your mind.\n\n[10:11] I don't think I would ever categorize one of these as a true networked intelligence\n\n[10:15] unless the mind being generated was actually smarter than the individual components each\n\n[10:19] were, at least at some task, and while some group of people working on a problem together\n\n[10:24] might come up with ideas faster and better than an individual could, and maybe even ones\n\n[10:29] no individual would have thought of, it's not really exhibiting much intelligence itself.\n\n[10:35] Of course in fiction it often is because its individual members have usually become drooling\n\n[10:40] morons.\n\n[10:41] At best one can justify this with the assumption that collective mind is using every spare\n\n[10:46] bit of processing power, up to and including the bits that process stuff like optical signals\n\n[10:51] so that people can walk right by the drones without even being seen maybe, but this is\n\n[10:55] mostly just bad writing.\n\n[10:58] Or very good writing.\n\n[10:59] In the case of Star Trek's Borg, the writers are presumably more focused on making them\n\n[11:03] a dreadful inhuman enemy that dehumanizes people, and nothing better shows that than\n\n[11:08] folks stumbling around without apparent self-awareness like a zombie, so I won't knock the writers\n\n[11:13] from a story standpoint, just a logical and science standpoint.\n\n[11:18] The Borg are idiots, individually and collectively, and I doubt that demonstrates an actual hive\n\n[11:24] mind properly even if I love them as villains.\n\n[11:27] I think I preferred Unity, a parody of the Borg from the cartoon Rick and Morty, where\n\n[11:32] the titular character Rick gets the hive mind Unity drunk and it comments how I probably\n\n[11:36] shouldn't be trying to run 200,000 pediatric hospitals and 12 million deep fryers in that\n\n[11:42] state, and it's a key point about such hive minds, that if you're composed of lots of\n\n[11:46] individual components designed for doing such things on their own you probably shouldn't\n\n[11:51] be running them.\n\n[11:53] Humans not only have components of ourselves we control subconsciously, but plenty of bits\n\n[11:57] that operate with no control whatsoever.\n\n[11:59] I don't need to tell my DNA to unzip and replicate, though it might be handy to be\n\n[12:04] able to tell it when to do that and when not to.\n\n[12:07] Indeed we do have some regulation methods inside the body and cancer can result when\n\n[12:12] that breaks down.\n\n[12:13] I'd imagine a hive mind could develop the equivalent of cancer, and if it layers up\n\n[12:17] a lot of minds, some minds that supervise this or that, it would have to worry not just\n\n[12:22] about individual members leaving or attacking if they did, but also some minds smaller hive\n\n[12:27] minds rebelling or breaking away.\n\n[12:30] Obviously the more autonomy you have at the lower levels the more of an issue that would\n\n[12:34] be, my kidneys have never tried to declare independence or stage a revolt.\n\n[12:39] Hive minds though could easily end up undergoing such breakaways or mitosis as a form of reproduction.\n\n[12:45] In the absence of instantaneous communication it might need to as well.\n\n[12:49] I mentioned a few episodes back in Digital Death that a human brain spread out to the\n\n[12:53] size of a planet but with its signals switched over to light speed ones would process at\n\n[12:58] the same rate as a normal human mind.\n\n[13:01] Get out beyond that and you'll either need some form of FTL communication or you will\n\n[13:05] start suffering time lag issues.\n\n[13:08] So spreading a hive mind over multiple planets, let alone solar systems, would seem a serious\n\n[13:13] limitation.\n\n[13:14] I tend to be skeptical about us ever inventing any form of FTL, but even if we grant it for\n\n[13:20] the moment, a lot of fictional and theoretical FTL methods are simply faster than light,\n\n[13:26] not instantaneous, or have some serious bandwidth issues.\n\n[13:30] You can probably run an interstellar empire on dial-up modem speeds, the old Battletech\n\n[13:35] and Mechwarrior franchise did that, but I can't see running a hive mind that way.\n\n[13:40] This is one possible Fermi Paradox solution that gets kicked around too, that aliens don't\n\n[13:45] spread out from their homeworld much because they converged to being hive minds or get\n\n[13:50] replaced by singular entities like a super-intelligent planet-sparling computer.\n\n[13:54] I tend not to bring it up in Fermi Paradox discussions because it's not a good one,\n\n[13:59] but it is of interest today.\n\n[14:00] It's not a good one because you can't assume every civilization does this, you can't\n\n[14:05] assume none would be willing to subdivide to found a new small hive mind in another\n\n[14:09] system, and it still suffers from the Dyson Dilemma, in that you can build Dyson Swarms\n\n[14:14] around your own home star and as we saw in the Mega Earths episode, you can't just\n\n[14:18] keep building those up with resources brought in from elsewhere until it is galactic mass\n\n[14:23] and hovering just above the critical density to turn into a black hole, either as a birch\n\n[14:27] planet or a truly huge Dyson Swarm of Dyson Swarms.\n\n[14:32] I think most hive minds would be willing to reproduce by making a new one elsewhere, but\n\n[14:37] they might not like the idea of essentially making a rival, and for that matter they might\n\n[14:42] need a certain minimum number of people just to make existence bearable for those colony\n\n[14:46] splinters.\n\n[14:47] In Kevin J. Anderson's Saga of the Seven Sons you've got a limited hive mind, the\n\n[14:52] Erdurens, who tend to need to do everything big, including their defense fleets, just\n\n[14:57] to have enough of them in one place to stay effective and sane.\n\n[15:00] The geth from the Mass Effect franchise had that issue too.\n\n[15:04] If that was hard to overcome, you'd probably need to bring resources back rather than expand.\n\n[15:10] Now there's the question of who would go out and retrieve those resources from around\n\n[15:13] the galaxy, but any hive mind that can't design an automated mining vessel obviously\n\n[15:18] came out a loser on that deal when it became one.\n\n[15:21] It's the same issue with folks living in virtual realities, they might not want to\n\n[15:26] abandon their paradise to go harvest resources far away, but they shouldn't have to.\n\n[15:31] If you can make simulated paradises, it implies you can make something smart enough to decently\n\n[15:36] mimic people to talk with in that paradise, so programming a ship to go gather stuff and\n\n[15:41] bring it back ought to be child's play, and one would tend to think a hive mind could\n\n[15:45] do it too, especially since they presumably had to be pretty good with intelligence and\n\n[15:49] computers to make their hive mind in the first place.\n\n[15:53] That skips those that naturally evolved, who are often shown as being awful with computers\n\n[15:58] because they never developed them.\n\n[16:00] We get that with Morning Light Mountain in Peter Hampton's Commonwealth Saga and with\n\n[16:04] the Buggles or Formics in Ender's Game, and lots of other insect hive examples.\n\n[16:09] The former, Morning Light Mountain, cannot naturally speak faster than light as most\n\n[16:14] the fictional examples can so it does have a decent head for electronics and cybernetics\n\n[16:19] but still never developed computers much.\n\n[16:21] In Ender's Game the Buggles do have instant communication and telepathy they naturally\n\n[16:26] evolved, indeed humans back-engineered their own interstellar communication off this.\n\n[16:31] Sort of.\n\n[16:32] They knew it could be done since they could tell by watching bugger ships react to things\n\n[16:36] faster than the speed of light should have permitted them to witness it, and knowing\n\n[16:39] it could be done humanity then figured it out.\n\n[16:42] It is implied they need a Queen reasonably nearby for this to work though, as a sort\n\n[16:46] of central node, though in later books it is stressed that the Queen's body is just\n\n[16:51] one more drone to her, albeit a critical one, and that she isn't really the Queen\n\n[16:55] or maybe even the Hive but more like our example earlier where your intelligence was run by\n\n[16:59] ants.\n\n[17:01] We also get a retcon about the individual Buggles actually having intelligence of their\n\n[17:04] own.\n\n[17:05] Orson Scott-Card is pretty good about consistent canon by and large but some explanations changed\n\n[17:11] over the series, tweaked for consistency I assume.\n\n[17:14] I remember when I did the Stupid Aliens episode and mentioned the book I irritated some folks\n\n[17:19] discussing the Buggles, that's not what it was in the book, and kept having to remind\n\n[17:23] folks that it isn't a book, it is a series of around 20 novels and short stories written\n\n[17:28] over 30 years, and that they weren't saying I was wrong, they were saying the author was.\n\n[17:33] Always a problem in science fiction when stuff needs retconning, or maybe didn't but got\n\n[17:38] it anyway, and a lot of folks were irritated when Alice Krieg showed up in Star Trek First\n\n[17:43] Contact, the film not the episode, as the Borg Queen, but it didn't bother me too\n\n[17:48] much personally.\n\n[17:50] The Borg originally spoke with one voice out of a thousand mouths, cold and alien and unified,\n\n[17:56] like a sociopathic chorus, so having a single queen talking seemed wrong.\n\n[18:01] But to be fair the Borg originally were going to be an insectoid hive race but they didn't\n\n[18:06] have the budget, so we get the black leather body horror look that seems like something\n\n[18:10] out of Clive Barker's Hellraiser franchise, so changes happen and it gave the audience\n\n[18:15] a central focus for the villain.\n\n[18:16] There's also no reason a hive can't have a mouthpiece, it's actually inefficient\n\n[18:21] to have a thousand people saying the exact same thing, and a hive doesn't have to be\n\n[18:26] homogenous with every member having the same function and status, insect hives aren't\n\n[18:30] like that after all, it could be a meat puppet to use as a collective voice or even a semi-independent\n\n[18:36] system.\n\n[18:37] Now the Borg are horrifying in their own right, but the usual thing that bugs people\n\n[18:42] about them is that membership tends not to be optional.\n\n[18:46] Even in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, the rather benevolent Hive Mind of Gaia, which\n\n[18:50] still has modest individuality for its members, is plotting galactic takeover and by conscription\n\n[18:56] not volunteers.\n\n[18:58] It was not a popular move with most fans either, myself included, and is often guessed as the\n\n[19:03] reason why all future books in the series were set before the incident.\n\n[19:08] Nonetheless there are tons of examples of good hive minds in science fiction, especially\n\n[19:12] when telepathy seemed to be an omnipresent feature even in hard science fiction novels.\n\n[19:17] A trend I'm glad finally died off in the last couple decades, but common or not, rarely\n\n[19:23] do I hear folks speaking of them with enthusiasm.\n\n[19:26] Pretty much the only member of a hive mind in fiction I like is Neville Clavaine from\n\n[19:30] the Revelation Space series.\n\n[19:32] It probably helps he's a viewpoint character who joins semi-voluntarily, never upgrades\n\n[19:37] his implants from the earlier versions that were less connected, and is often on bad terms\n\n[19:41] with his own faction, the Conjoiners, so he doesn't exactly cheerlead for them.\n\n[19:46] They also don't indiscriminately spread and assimilate folks involuntarily either.\n\n[19:51] Interestingly Clavaine's faction in the books is often in conflict with the other\n\n[19:55] faction of humanity that is closest to being a hive mind too, the Demarchists.\n\n[20:00] They are more of a bunch of intelligences who are networked, so to speak, as like most\n\n[20:04] people they have a ton of mental implants but one of theirs, and the key one for their\n\n[20:09] specific civilization, is one that tries to go straight democracy, no representatives,\n\n[20:14] by having everyone vote on almost everything.\n\n[20:17] Sort of like if every bill in congress got text messages to you for a vote, only as best\n\n[20:22] as I can tell the implants allow them to do it mostly subconsciously and even asleep.\n\n[20:26] I assume the implants in everyone's head know them individually well enough to guess\n\n[20:30] how they'd respond.\n\n[20:32] Forgetting the specific mechanics, that is kind of the ideal of most versions of democracy\n\n[20:37] and its parallels.\n\n[20:39] Everyone gets a say in what happens because everyone has an investment in the outcome\n\n[20:43] and a right to self-determination, so networking folks to make news and details easier to get\n\n[20:48] and absorb to make more informed decisions seems ideal.\n\n[20:53] If you're not really taken too far you get a hive mind where nobody gets any say\n\n[20:57] in anything because there's no individuality left over.\n\n[21:00] The other big issue is the privacy one, and that's a serious issue of the future even\n\n[21:05] when you're not telepathically linked to other people.\n\n[21:08] However in the networked intelligence case, short of a hive mind, I do think that is just\n\n[21:14] an artifact of telepathy in science fiction.\n\n[21:17] We associate telepathy as reading people's minds, not just the equivalent of a phone\n\n[21:22] or internet connection, so a method using that will understandably make you figure all\n\n[21:27] those minds can read each other and freely look around or even merge.\n\n[21:31] Again part of why I don't like telepathy in fiction, made up non-science makes for\n\n[21:35] bad extrapolations of the future.\n\n[21:38] Folks end up picturing some mind-eating hive or a bunch of folks joining hands around a\n\n[21:42] drum circle to meditate and combine their souls.\n\n[21:46] My computer, and thus me, is connected to the internet and to you, obviously, or you\n\n[21:51] couldn't hear me now.\n\n[21:52] I've never noticed my smartphone trying to merge into my brain even when I'm holding\n\n[21:56] it next to my head or my computer trying to eat my neighbors.\n\n[22:00] I can read my files from other computers in my house or on a network but only the ones\n\n[22:05] I've shared.\n\n[22:06] When you're doing this stuff with mystical telepathy that presumably can't be done\n\n[22:10] or it takes special effort and training.\n\n[22:12] But when you do it with technology you have to understand how it all works, how brains\n\n[22:17] and memory function, to do it in the first place.\n\n[22:20] So segmenting things off or only sharing specific chosen bits is possible from the outset.\n\n[22:26] And if I want people to know what my schedule is, I can make that open just like my Google\n\n[22:31] Calendar, or if I want only my doctor to be able to look at my medical status, I can do\n\n[22:36] that too.\n\n[22:37] So I think when we're talking about a technological route to a more networked intelligence, we\n\n[22:42] do not necessarily have to discard privacy and individuality to gain the many obvious\n\n[22:47] benefits.\n\n[22:48] You also probably don't have to go the all in or out option, one size fits all.\n\n[22:54] Living in a city traditionally cuts down privacy a bit, hence many of us prefer the peace and\n\n[22:58] solitude of the country, doesn't mean we're divorced from civilization.\n\n[23:02] So too, one can presumably set up such a network to allow people variable involvement to fit\n\n[23:08] their tastes, in general and at the moment.\n\n[23:12] Also just like civilization you could enjoy sub-networks, I'm part of humanity and the\n\n[23:17] US and my state of Ohio and my little village and dozens of various related and unrelated\n\n[23:22] social or professional groups, my level of involvement in each varies, and I can adjust\n\n[23:28] my commitment.\n\n[23:29] You could have a human overmind with say the sub-mind of Ohio, which was both a separate\n\n[23:34] entity and part of the Earth Mind at the same time, and how much so might fluctuate, as\n\n[23:39] might its membership, with some joining or leaving and involving themselves to varying\n\n[23:44] degrees.\n\n[23:45] Werner Wiench explores this notion with a race called the Tynes in his classic novel\n\n[23:50] A Fire Upon the Deep, where we see small group minds of often just a few critters that often\n\n[23:55] switch members who are not really individuals on their own.\n\n[23:59] There are a lot of options for this in fiction, but I would tend to guess people who predict\n\n[24:03] this as an eventuality for humans are semi-correct.\n\n[24:07] Just my guess but the error being made is that folks don't want to give up their privacy\n\n[24:11] and individuality and must eventually mature to be okay with that, and I personally don't\n\n[24:16] see that as more mature or necessary, that you have to sacrifice privacy or individuality\n\n[24:22] to enjoy the benefits of a greater degree of networking and group cooperation, though\n\n[24:28] I could easily see a lot of folks choosing that route and so long as admission is voluntary\n\n[24:33] more power to them.\n\n[24:35] Obviously if you're too interdependent it makes it hard to get out there and settle\n\n[24:38] the galaxy and we'll be looking at a first step to that next week in Colonizing the\n\n[24:42] Oort Cloud, which contains tons of potential places for us to colonize but usually so far\n\n[24:48] apart even compared to planets that no unified hive mind would be viable.\n\n[24:53] The week after that, we'll leave the solar system and continue to explore the problems\n\n[24:57] with unification, especially with light speed limitations, in Interstellar Empires, and\n\n[25:03] Then we'll finish out 2017 by heading out of the galaxy and asking if it is even possible\n\n[25:08] to settle other galaxies in a universe without faster than light travel.\n\n[25:13] For alerts when those and other episodes come out, make sure to subscribe to the channel\n\n[25:17] and hit the like button, and if

        "transcription": "[00:00] Hi everyone, welcome to Fawzi's Biotech and Health Extension group.\n\n[00:03] I'm really excited to finally have Ivelin Bishop here today with us.\n\n[00:07] We've been in contact with you for years now, on and off, we've been trying to schedule something.\n\n[00:12] We're really excited about your work and you've been definitely really wrapping it up over the past few years.\n\n[00:17] So I think it's a really great time to have you on.\n\n[00:19] Today you will be discussing in the group about healthy longevity medicine in the clinical practice,\n\n[00:26] which is definitely a topic that I think has become rather of interest lately.\n\n[00:31] So I'm really excited for the Q&A afterwards.\n\n[00:34] I'm sure people have lots of questions and comments and contributing similar efforts.\n\n[00:38] So without further ado, thank you so so much for joining.\n\n[00:41] I'll share a lot more about you in the chat, but for now, please take it away.\n\n[00:44] I'm very excited to have you.\n\n[00:46] Thank you so much. It's a great honor and pleasure to be here and I'm great for this opportunity.\n\n[00:51] And really congratulations to the Forsyth Institute to do it and to do it on such a scale.\n\n[00:58] I will share my slides and of course, very much looking forward to the Q&A session,\n\n[01:04] which is usually much more engaging and valuable.\n\n[01:08] When I was choosing that topic, I tried to be a little bit broader because I would like to not only discuss,\n\n[01:13] you know, whatever people already discussed in terms of the clinicians and in terms of what we want to do with health,\n\n[01:19] span versus lifespan versus the theory for the clinic that we know.\n\n[01:24] I just really wanted to talk a little bit about practical examples of what is already being done across the globe\n\n[01:31] and then really to say what is planned as in agenda by specific societies or groups.\n\n[01:39] So I would nevertheless love to start with an announcement and warm invitation to the ERDD conference.\n\n[01:47] This year, it's the 11th time that it will take place in Copenhagen.\n\n[01:52] It's, I guess, by now one of the largest aging and longevity conferences.\n\n[01:57] And since COVID, basically, we also have an integrated time specific slot for longevity medicine session.\n\n[02:06] It grew from a workshop to half a day to last year, a full day, the opening day.\n\n[02:12] And this year it expands further and it will be a whole longevity medicine track.\n\n[02:17] So it will be the full first day.\n\n[02:19] And on top of that, also other tracks along the entire conference.\n\n[02:24] Longevity medicine track will really accommodate for the clinical part and allow not only clinical discussion,\n\n[02:30] clinical trial discussions and really have a platform for doctors and healthcare professionals and affiliates to discuss various topics.\n\n[02:40] And usually we also have a co-moderator that graciously allows us to co-host the day.\n\n[02:47] Last year it was Michael Baxson from Nature Medicine.\n\n[02:50] Before that was Nature Aging.\n\n[02:51] Before that was National Health Longevity.\n\n[02:53] This year it will be revealed a little bit later.\n\n[02:55] But one thing I can already reveal is that this year conference will be also co-organized, more or less,\n\n[03:03] or will be also done partially in partnership with Express HealthSpan.\n\n[03:08] And especially with Jamie, where we are structuring the first day of Longevity Medicine Day,\n\n[03:14] a little bit together to be more aligned with hand in hand,\n\n[03:17] since Express HealthSpan is really focusing on how can we do something for the patient\n\n[03:23] and how can you bring the research to the clinic.\n\n[03:27] So this will be also the time where the endpoints will be announced and the guidelines of the prize.\n\n[03:35] And another that I want to mention that I usually always mention in my presentation,\n\n[03:39] but here I would also like to make a few announcements.\n\n[03:42] And whoever is interested to join and collaborate, everybody is always welcome, is the Longevity Education Hub.\n\n[03:49] So talking about HealthSpan, healthy longevity medicine, whatever we want to do,\n\n[03:54] I think the first step is always education of physicians, education of healthcare professionals and others.\n\n[04:00] But myself, I only know medicine.\n\n[04:03] So I was focusing on the education of the doctors and we created Longevity Education Hub,\n\n[04:09] which is offering free courses that are CME accredited by the AAMCA for introduction and then also expanded course.\n\n[04:20] And doctors who pass the quiz over 80% can also get the CME accreditation.\n\n[04:25] And still, now for the past four years,\n\n[04:28] we have been accessing still the only course that CME accredited globally for longevity medicine,\n\n[04:33] which is a very nice thing because we went to build national chapters.\n\n[04:38] And I think we have right now about 10 chapters covering 80% of the globe,\n\n[04:42] both Spanish with Chinese with Arabic courses.\n\n[04:46] And the thing that really was in our long term vision, which is starting right now,\n\n[04:51] is to bring this curriculum into men's schools and also into all residences and fellowships,\n\n[04:57] so really the last part, the practical part of the education of the doctors before they become specialists.\n\n[05:04] So that we can really advance the field and bring more clinicians into the field.\n\n[05:10] And the dream is really to have medical students finish in med school knowing what is really longevity,\n\n[05:16] knowing the mechanisms of aging and not to learn them as they go and mostly they have no time to learn it later.\n\n[05:23] So those two big announcements before I move on and usually I always start with this slide\n\n[05:30] because for me until it changes, it always reflects longevity medicine.\n\n[05:34] So I started from Alice in Wonderland, so they are running with the Red Queen.\n\n[05:39] And after running very fast, they stop and they are in the same place.\n\n[05:42] And, you know, Alice is asking why are we in the same place and the Queen is saying\n\n[05:46] that she won't actually advance, she has to run double as fast.\n\n[05:49] And that's pretty much what healthy longevity is for me.\n\n[05:52] So we are constantly running because there is just so much knowledge from neuroscience, from AI, from computing.\n\n[05:58] Now with generative AI, we're really becoming a mainstream.\n\n[06:01] And at the same time, we really also want to advance.\n\n[06:04] So that's a full-time job and a little bit more since, again, we do not have healthy longevity medicine yet as a separate discipline.\n\n[06:13] So those who actually practice it usually have also another foot somewhere else in their own home disciplines.\n\n[06:22] Or they do this, but then it's very difficult to integrate it into the typical healthcare setting that we have right now,\n\n[06:31] the healthcare systems.\n\n[06:33] And that's a little bit of a problem because it then remains something relatively closed.\n\n[06:39] But before we go into that, I would just like to mention how the definition of healthy longevity medicine\n\n[06:45] or longevity medicine has been evolving.\n\n[06:48] And it basically started a little bit in the year 2021 with the publication in Nature Aging\n\n[06:53] based on the ERDD presentation of Dr. Kai Fuli saying that longevity medicine is basically\n\n[07:00] AI-based precision medicine focusing on the health span and the lifespan.\n\n[07:04] It was pretty much the first time that somebody said it and published it in this way.\n\n[07:10] So it's not only the lifespan, primarily the health span.\n\n[07:13] And this is powered by AI technology.\n\n[07:16] Here we meant mostly the biological aging clock.\n\n[07:19] The definition has been transformed a little bit when healthy longevity medicine society was found.\n\n[07:27] Some of you might know it.\n\n[07:28] It is a society that is actually creating a platform to further bring longevity medicine\n\n[07:36] into the field as a sub-discipline, probably first a sub-discipline under internal medicine,\n\n[07:43] which also of course includes family medicine and then to hopefully also separate disciplinary\n\n[07:51] or net.\n\n[07:51] Definitely it has to be positioned as something where the doctors can be certified,\n\n[07:56] can be educated, certified, qualified properly, and also have the way to have the so-called\n\n[08:02] continuous, continued education to always be on top of their knowledge.\n\n[08:07] And this society, when we first came together in the executive committee,\n\n[08:12] we were thinking long time and discussing brainstorming and came up with the definition\n\n[08:18] that healthy longevity medicine, actually this healthy came on top of longevity medicine as we\n\n[08:23] were talking to really distinct ourselves a little bit from what longevity medicine\n\n[08:28] partially became along the years.\n\n[08:31] And instead, the definition will be optimizing health span along the lifespan by targeting\n\n[08:38] age-related processes.\n\n[08:39] So really, including the fact that we are working on age-related processes rather than\n\n[08:47] on aged populations, of course we learned from them a lot, but it's not only the thing and\n\n[08:54] it's a health span target across the entire lifespan.\n\n[08:58] That's the committee.\n\n[09:00] Here I just wanted to mention that many familiar faces, but one face might not be so familiar,\n\n[09:06] Professor Harold Pimpus, who is a psychiatrist.\n\n[09:08] He's the head of Psych at Columbia and Presbyterian.\n\n[09:11] And this is just to say that in healthy longevity medicine very often, we don't forget and we\n\n[09:18] will always keep in mind that brain cognition and also mental health is very important,\n\n[09:24] but actually to practically have that integrated into a healthy longevity medicine society,\n\n[09:29] I found that very important and I was very happy that this happened.\n\n[09:35] Now, as we are talking about bringing health and longevity medicine into the mainstream\n\n[09:40] healthcare, into something that can really be practiced, we need several things.\n\n[09:46] Of course, it's a puzzle, but we have to start somewhere.\n\n[09:49] And we started with a bunch of white papers.\n\n[09:52] Actually, our most recent paper was out a week ago or something.\n\n[09:57] It's called Building Longevity Departments in Public Clinical Settings.\n\n[10:03] You can look it up in Geoscience, which is actually telling about how did we, as the\n\n[10:09] working group of HLMS, which is constituted of Mayo and US and Sheba Israel, how we came\n\n[10:18] towards building longevity departments in public settings from building the team to\n\n[10:24] educating healthcare professionals to finding the budgets, to finding the right diagnostics,\n\n[10:29] of course, and to also interventions that are already being done for those patients\n\n[10:34] who are coming to the departments in the public setting.\n\n[10:38] But then also we will hopefully very soon have a paper on the actual definition\n\n[10:42] of longevity medicine and then for the white people to be coming now.\n\n[10:48] Of course, we immediately jumped on education.\n\n[10:52] Since the beginning of August 2022, we already had our monthly case discussions in HLMS where\n\n[11:01] not only medical doctors, but healthcare professionals and affiliates were able to\n\n[11:07] really discuss cases.\n\n[11:08] We didn't want to call it case presentations because we all do not have yet binding guidelines\n\n[11:15] and recommendations for healthy longevity medicine as in clinical setting.\n\n[11:20] But it was important for us to have a platform to discuss among those who actually practice it\n\n[11:26] or who are planning to practice.\n\n[11:29] That is still happening.\n\n[11:30] But a very important overarching goal is really to create guidelines for longevity medicine\n\n[11:38] and quality controls for doctors and for clinics.\n\n[11:43] Have a set of as it is done for any other discipline and as it is done in any other\n\n[11:48] setting where clinics and doctors have to be undergoing quality control or ongoing\n\n[11:54] pain sick and also where a discipline has a set of clear guidelines.\n\n[11:59] This is something that we want to achieve.\n\n[12:01] This has to start first with building guidelines and how to build guidelines for longevity\n\n[12:06] medicine, which is very different than in any other discipline that is focusing on sick care.\n\n[12:13] Not only because of the ICD coding that is very different and focused on pathologies,\n\n[12:18] of course, but also because at this very moment there is just not enough evidence in clinical\n\n[12:25] trials and many things.\n\n[12:26] One would say then how can you build guidelines?\n\n[12:28] Well, we would start, of course, as always with the lowest level of guidance, which are\n\n[12:33] recommendations, just three or C, whoever wants to call it which way, and then to build\n\n[12:39] it up towards guidelines.\n\n[12:41] Guidelines, both in interventions and in diagnostics.\n\n[12:45] Of course, we have to start to diagnostics because the most important thing right now\n\n[12:50] for the success of clinical trials is the definition of the right end points and those\n\n[12:57] are the biomarkers of aging.\n\n[12:59] Luckily, within the last almost two years now we have consortium of aging biomarkers,\n\n[13:06] both the aging biomarker consortium in the US but also big biomarker consortium in China\n\n[13:13] and both of them are doing a great job to build it up.\n\n[13:17] Here just to show once again where are in the world already longevity, I like to say\n\n[13:23] longevity departments.\n\n[13:24] One might say longevity centers where people can come and undergo some level of longevity\n\n[13:32] diagnostics for our center here in Shiba.\n\n[13:36] It's fully for free and we will have this year 1,500 people who will undergo 360 screening\n\n[13:43] for longevity at baseline six months and then 12 months.\n\n[13:47] All of those people would be in the study.\n\n[13:49] 80% would be randomizing to interventions and would be given or are given interventions\n\n[13:55] for a year to come and then there will be a crossover.\n\n[13:58] On the one hand, that's already a service for people coming from across the country\n\n[14:04] to be screened but at the same time, of course, the end points which will include the biomarkers\n\n[14:09] but also compliance will hopefully be something that can be presented to health insurances\n\n[14:18] to say it actually makes sense by the economical calculation to implement some sort of program\n\n[14:24] in the packages and to have people giving the accessibility to such longevity services.\n\n[14:33] Overall, of course, it's an ongoing learning and as we are learning and translating healthy\n\n[14:38] longevity medicine, I think almost every month we are adding something new into the center,\n\n[14:43] being from a new technology for diagnostics to some new flocks that are out there,\n\n[14:48] new signatures for methylation. That's extremely fun to do and beautiful but at the same time,\n\n[14:55] really this tertiary digital layer of the patient expands. It's a lot of data.\n\n[15:00] It's a huge amount of data and it's a data lake that is hard to handle in clinics that are\n\n[15:07] primed for significant care that have been in the system for years and decades and more.\n\n[15:12] And so the EHR really has to expand in a way that only a center that is really open-minded can do,\n\n[15:22] which is very interesting. And of course, without AI, it's impossible. So it's very important once\n\n[15:31] a center has decided to be a longevity center and be at a scale that goes into thousands rather than\n\n[15:39] hundreds. It's very important to have besides the strong IT in the background, besides the strong\n\n[15:46] data lake capacity in the background, also an AI arm that can fuel in all this information\n\n[15:53] continuously and hopefully be connected to something that is teaching a very large LLM.\n\n[16:00] So large language models, I think, in health and longevity medicine as we speak are being trained.\n\n[16:05] AI is learning constantly. There are big transformers being conducted and done.\n\n[16:11] Some of the publications are already even available. I will show them in a moment.\n\n[16:17] And one has to think about that as a doctor who is creating such a or running such a department\n\n[16:22] to have this in the background. So what one can see on the surface, all the testings, all the center,\n\n[16:29] equipment, all the doctors who are there as they usually would be. The power is in the\n\n[16:35] backside. The power is in the AI that is behind it. And I think we are seeing really a constant\n\n[16:43] revolution of what the field is. So when we tried to do a timeline, we saw there was quite a fast\n\n[16:52] progress in general up until the year 2015. We had the Hallmarks of Aging, the Seminar\n\n[16:59] publication, we had the Harvard Clock, which was for me personally a huge revolution. I remember\n\n[17:05] learning at the med school and it really transformed and shifted our minds of doctors from telomeres.\n\n[17:12] There might be something more in terms of aging. There's something more that controls it. And there\n\n[17:17] was also CRISP coming up. Then really the biggest point came, I think, in the year 2015,\n\n[17:23] where we started to see more and more AI in medicine and all the comics revolution came on.\n\n[17:29] And then also deep aging clocks were coming. And this is thanks to the fact that around this time,\n\n[17:35] the deep neural networks were developed and really applied in order to really have the data\n\n[17:42] analyzed first structured and then analyzed in a way that would bring a sanctionable objective out\n\n[17:49] this something that is usable, such as biological age. And then the wearables came. So\n\n[17:58] healthy longevity medicine without wearables and very good integration of those wearables\n\n[18:04] in the API and daily use is impossible. So it's very important to use it.\n\n[18:11] And then the clinical trials and supplements came and more and more. Until now, even as I mentioned,\n\n[18:18] we have large-handwich models, we have transformers that are being built. And that's something that I'm\n\n[18:24] extremely excited about. Actually, healthy longevity medicine has been using generative\n\n[18:28] AI for a long time. It was just not as accessible to people until CHEP GPT came out. But it was\n\n[18:37] already being announced and everything that's generative AI was allowing us to use was already\n\n[18:42] being applied in order to, as I mentioned before, be able to integrate structure and analyze the\n\n[18:51] at large scale longitudinally, but also data that is really extremely heterogeneous and multimodal.\n\n[18:59] Because for healthy longevity medicine, we have to go from the omics to the systems,\n\n[19:03] through the organs, neptests, radiomics, actually at this point of time, historical records,\n\n[19:10] very deep anonymistic records, and so on. Up until the point that we also tried to\n\n[19:17] get as much data points as possible from the epigenetics. So from the environment,\n\n[19:21] the influences on the person themselves that actually changed the epigenome. And that was only\n\n[19:28] possible with the learning methods that allowed us to get some sort of objective function out of\n\n[19:35] it. The objective function mostly was personalized medicine, advice, recommendation, and right now,\n\n[19:41] much more, for example, AI based drugs, which we'll talk about just in a moment.\n\n[19:47] Now, as I mentioned, deep neural networks were tremendously important for that to happen, but\n\n[19:56] also other versions of learning. There are good sources to learn about that there's actually a\n\n[20:02] chapter in the book called AI and longevity medicine that is talking much more deeper about\n\n[20:08] federal learning and transfer learning that were used in order to get what you call today biological\n\n[20:15] aging clocks, but also other personalized recommendations. And as I mentioned before,\n\n[20:21] generative AI and longevity medicine has been used already before really to integrate all the\n\n[20:26] sets from those very different data points, extremely heterogeneous through the neural networks\n\n[20:32] into something that is actionable for a clinic. For example, what is the aging pathway that is being\n\n[20:37] targeted? What are the synthetic data out of it? What are the potential trackable targets? How to\n\n[20:44] build a track out of this information? So that was already happening. Now going out of the deep AI,\n\n[20:54] how does it translate to an actual practice? What can we do? And how is longevity medicine\n\n[21:00] different from prevention? How is it different or how does it fit into also our reactive medicine\n\n[21:08] reality? So I don't claim that this is the right way to see it. For me, it just helps to see it\n\n[21:15] this way that first we have reactive medicine and it will not disappear for seenables. We treat\n\n[21:21] diseases, we react to a disease and that's important and basically any doctor has to know\n\n[21:27] how to do that. Then there is prevention, prevention from primary to tertiary prevention.\n\n[21:32] It's a proactive approach, we detect early diseases. So therefore the disease is already there or\n\n[21:37] early recurrence, right? But there is already a pathology that we detect and we detect early\n\n[21:42] in order to remove and treat that pathology. So that's also great and that's very well established\n\n[21:46] there are clear guidelines and that's very important. Now what's different in healthy\n\n[21:50] longevity medicine? Depending on the scale how it's being done, it can encompass also prevention\n\n[21:56] or be an additional part to prevention. I think both are totally okay. And for example, for us,\n\n[22:03] we separate, right? We have a specific order center that is doing prevention with all the screenings,\n\n[22:09] with colonoscopies, mammographies and others. And we do the extras, right? From the functional\n\n[22:14] testing to the methylation to biological age and so on. But there are centers that integrate both,\n\n[22:21] also fine, that goes hand in hand, but it's so different. And in this part, really longevity\n\n[22:28] medicine is about detecting the risk of developing a disease and trying to assess the gravity or the\n\n[22:35] dimension of that specific risk for a specific patient and bring the patient from current status\n\n[22:42] of different markers to the optimal status of those markers in order to optimize the health\n\n[22:49] span. And I'm probably repeating myself and I'm talking to the experts here, but nevertheless,\n\n[22:54] I think it has to be said, we are extending our life expectancy tremendously fast and it has\n\n[23:01] expanded in the past hundred years, but the health span didn't extend at the same speed and therefore\n\n[23:07] we have the gap. And so healthy longevity medicine is really trying to close that gap.\n\n[23:13] And so primarily it's really not about further extending the lifespan. For some people, it is,\n\n[23:18] you know, by product that is desirable, which is great, that's the desire, but it's really about\n\n[23:25] closing the gap of health span and lifespan and extending the healthy years of life. So basically\n\n[23:33] age and disease or death with good health. And because the definition is optimizing health span\n\n[23:44] along with lifespan, we are talking about also really optimizing a point of life that we could\n\n[23:53] call a peak performance or peak individual performance. Basically in normal real world\n\n[24:00] scenario in medicine and beyond, we would look at patient's chronological age along the lifespan\n\n[24:07] of a patient and we would see that the patient is going, you know, to a curve of life. I'm sure you've\n\n[24:13] seen that before in different places that's actually taken from the Nature Aging publication.\n\n[24:18] So we basically see a patient who is, you know, being born and until the adolescent is being\n\n[24:24] usually guided by one or two doctors, neonatologists, pediatricians, and we all know\n\n[24:31] the norms. So everything is very normative. There are ranges by chronological age. A child has to\n\n[24:37] achieve this and this and that within a specific age. That's basically how it's being done.\n\n[24:43] Until the person is reaching this level, which is that peak individual performance, this is usually\n\n[24:49] a short interval of our life where we have the top functionality of our body and mind.\n\n[24:55] And from that moment on, it's a functional decline at different pace for different people.\n\n[25:02] And usually this is also where different doctors are evaluating the person within norms that are\n\n[25:10] mostly based on chronological age, but not only, but these are the norms. We have the normative\n\n[25:15] values and they are, you know, we usually in the clinic, we love what's outside the norm,\n\n[25:20] what's within the norm. And then we try to act if needed or if possible. And that's pretty much it.\n\n[25:29] Of course there are limitations because doctors' memory is extremely limited and there is a\n\n[25:33] dispersion. You know, if there's two or three doctors looking at the case, there will always be\n\n[25:39] a problem to bring everybody together at the same point. So there is a lot of information that is\n\n[25:46] leaking and usually that leaked information is not beneficial for the patient outcome. So the decline\n\n[25:52] is going towards very often a very comorbid or multi-morbid end of life.\n\n[25:59] Now in health and longevity medicine, as you can see, it's not a tremendously extended lifespan\n\n[26:06] here. So the length of life, the years of life might say the same or maybe a little longer,\n\n[26:11] again, buying product. What we are really trying to focus here is to have the patient being as\n\n[26:17] close as possible to patient's personal, individual peak performance. So how we do that? We are trying\n\n[26:28] our best to develop and to use biological aging clocks and really to evaluate the patient with\n\n[26:34] algorithms that are trying to tell us not only how old the patient is biologically at a specific\n\n[26:40] point of time, but also what would be the optimal biological age of that patient at that specific\n\n[26:48] point of time and which parameters need to be fixed in order to bring that patient back.\n\n[26:56] And for this, of course, we are mostly using longitudinal data. I usually tell patients\n\n[27:02] I usually tell patients, please do share with me anything that you have from your old data,\n\n[27:08] simply because the more the better and the more longitudinal in the past those data points are,\n\n[27:16] the better the predictions of what can be optimized. And so therefore, longevity medicine\n\n[27:23] is really standing on two pillars in my opinion. We have the diagnostics and we have the interventions\n\n[27:29] Luckily right now, the intervention part is growing more and more. A few years ago,\n\n[27:33] it was primarily diagnostics and there was a lot of criticism saying, why do we do all this?\n\n[27:39] We have nothing that we can really do about it. And the answer was if we don't test\n\n[27:46] with this new longevity diagnostic precision medicine, and if we don't fuel it into the\n\n[27:51] algorithm, we will never be able to find, identify the right endpoints, the right biomarkers for\n\n[27:58] clinical trials. And this is exactly what was happening in the past years. And this is why\n\n[28:05] luckily we see more and more of those endpoints and biomarkers being validated and therefore useful\n\n[28:13] for clinical trials. So finally, we can test which supplements are beneficial for extension\n\n[28:18] of health plan and which are not and also repurposed drugs and also hope to be very soon new\n\n[28:23] components, both analytics and your protectors and also technologies, right? And to check if\n\n[28:31] they are beneficial or not. So what is happening are mostly now as I'm showing now, the longevity\n\n[28:37] diagnostic centers, we have a whole fan again, going from either only longevity diagnostics or\n\n[28:45] preventative and longevity diagnostics ranging from pulled by the MRIs with overlay AI algorithm\n\n[28:54] through other radiomics, through functional tests, through labs, very extensive lab,\n\n[29:00] and also through wearables and also through more and more liquid biopsies and of course,\n\n[29:06] omics and microbiome. So microbiomics one could say, and hopefully very soon,\n\n[29:12] a much bigger panel on biological aging clocks. And what already was established and is now being\n\n[29:20] even more important and useful in the clinical practice is the polygenic risk score. So really\n\n[29:26] having the mosaic of the genes and saying, not only do you have this and this pathological\n\n[29:33] mutation or you're a carrier of this and this disease, which is important, which is good to\n\n[29:37] have a WGS, but also the polygenic risk score really to see the mosaic of where is the patient\n\n[29:43] standing in terms of risk to develop a disease at a specific point of time that is really correlated\n\n[29:51] to mortality. So CVS and dementia and their own, so not only cancer and pharmacogenomics. Luckily,\n\n[29:59] it's really becoming a mainstream and most clinics I've been working with, public setting also have\n\n[30:06] pharmacogenomics being done at least once and where we are guiding our treatment,\n\n[30:12] if a treatment is needed with the help of pharmacogenomics.\n\n[30:17] And last but not least, of course, wearables. I personally am a big fan of those. I think it's a\n\n[30:22] great tool for feedback, but also for the doctor to have the chance to have an instant glimpse of\n\n[30:29] continuous monitoring. And besides of the things that we all know from the wearable\n\n[30:35] CGNs, all the bands of the rings for the high HRE and all the other vital signs,\n\n[30:42] I think we are all more and more excited also to have the continuous cholesterol monitors being\n\n[30:48] improved and validated, mini polysomnographies in from even of a ring for the night that are giving\n\n[30:55] us quite valuable data for the sleep apnea and movement. And last but not least, really a very\n\n[31:01] good monitoring of our liquids as in liquid biopsies. So really not only checking in the blood\n\n[31:09] for pan cancer panels or cancer panels, CTDNAs or RNAs or CTCs, so circulating tumor cells,\n\n[31:18] but more and more in liquids or other samples such as stool, such as urine. Stool is very\n\n[31:24] established already with the PoloGuard, but not many people know that there are urine tests that\n\n[31:29] are testing for prostate and bladder cancer. And hopefully we'll have more and more of those types\n\n[31:34] of fluids that can be tested. And of course, also breath, so volatile particles that are also\n\n[31:39] predictive of cancer from lung to other endocrine cancers. So I think those things are extremely\n\n[31:46] valuable because all of those data points, if they can be integrated properly, will give us\n\n[31:54] really a patient's digital twin and help us to understand which of the levels of aging for a\n\n[32:01] specific patient are accelerated. Is it the molecular level, the cell level, tissue, organ system?\n\n[32:08] Is the epigenetic not really fitted for the patient, the influence of the environment? And\n\n[32:14] at the same time, which really of the function, so the functionalities, which of the functionalities\n\n[32:20] for the patient clinically is decreasing? Is it the vital capacity? Is it really the only\n\n[32:25] oligofactory system? Which of the system and the organs and functions altogether are decreasing\n\n[32:31] for a patient specifically? This allows not only to know, but also to optimize the longevity\n\n[32:39] diagnostic and monitoring protocol. And as you can see here, it has to be granular and has to be\n\n[32:45] individualized. And some things extend from something that has to be done daily continuously\n\n[32:52] and to points that can be done once in a lifetime, such as whole genome sequencing, and then just to\n\n[32:58] recheck for new mutations as our knowledge of genes is growing. But at the same time,\n\n[33:05] this type of protocol is not only about do those tests, take those pills. It's a whole package of\n\n[33:13] a longevity protocol, which also is very important. The education of the patient\n\n[33:18] is a longevity program ready to strategically tell the patient not only sleep well, eat well, move,\n\n[33:25] but to strategically say, you have to do this exercise so and so many times for so and so many\n\n[33:31] minutes with this and this rate, with this and this time to rest to achieve this and that specific\n\n[33:38] outcome for your caliper or your group strength or whatsoever this is. So really going very granular\n\n[33:45] and individual for the patient's specific needs. Of course, we have a great help now with the\n\n[33:52] biological aging clocks and we have a whole variety of those and they are expanding and then it's just\n\n[33:57] so wonderful to see. By far, what I'm showing here is not everything that we have. And this is just an\n\n[34:04] example of the deep aging clocks, but very valuable to see that the variety that is out there\n\n[34:11] and all the different people who are developing those, there is a very collaborative spirit\n\n[34:16] because we will need to know which clock is actually measuring what. Besides of the fact to\n\n[34:22] know that, oh, this is my biological age, every doctor and hopefully also the patient will\n\n[34:27] understand what this actually means for me. Why is my epigenetic clock showing me minus 20 years,\n\n[34:31] but my blood clock is showing me plus five? Where's the problem? How does it differ? How\n\n[34:36] do they measure those values? I think it's very important to understand, okay, this algorithm is\n\n[34:42] behind and epigenetic clocks are measuring your age, but they are oscillating around an axis\n\n[34:50] and the blood clock, for example, is really based on those 45s and blood markers and it is\n\n[34:58] predictive for mortality, but hey, maybe morbidity is different and other factors were not included.\n\n[35:05] And then at some point in time, once hopefully we will have a much thicker data set that will\n\n[35:10] be also shared between each other, we will be able to understand what are the inter-functions\n\n[35:16] and intersections and influences between each other between those biological aging clocks.\n\n[35:21] On top of that, it will be very important to have specific organ clocks and organ\n\n[35:27] clocks that are working on data sets that are maybe not mainstream. So clocks based on\n\n[35:32] epidemics, clocks based only on specific function of the heart, but on the structure,\n\n[35:38] not only on the functionality like HRV. Those are the things that are all in a pipeline,\n\n[35:43] not validated, but ongoing. And I think that it's very important for us in the clinic to embrace them\n\n[35:50] in order really to validate. And what is also extremely important and growing, I think,\n\n[35:56] is the focus on a microbiome. So I just wanted to mention that there are already\n\n[36:03] efforts to, and there are already clocks out there that are based on microbiome and there\n\n[36:08] are efforts to extend those and the new, which is I think extremely important, microbiome plays\n\n[36:14] a tremendously important role, but also clocks that are very much focusing on reproductive health\n\n[36:22] in the productive age and then later menopause, and repulse, especially, I see Aaron is here\n\n[36:29] and very focused on menopause and extremely focused on under pulse. And I think once we know more,\n\n[36:35] once we really understand longitudinally which hormones are changing, how can we actually measure\n\n[36:40] the reproductive biological age or have a menopause at clock, we can do a lot more than just HRT,\n\n[36:47] hormone replacement therapy. And then as I mentioned also before, how can we really see\n\n[36:53] the interactions and the proportions and interchanges of those different clocks\n\n[37:02] between each other? That's very important. And how it usually looks like, for example,\n\n[37:07] for the blood age like this, most of you probably have seen it, maybe some not,\n\n[37:12] we usually after fueling in the algorithm, we get an output report and such a report is\n\n[37:19] giving us a chronological age and then the biological age. So this was actually a patient\n\n[37:24] young male, 41, biologically 45, without really many of the factors that were extremely out of\n\n[37:32] the norm. So in a normative setting, we'll say, okay, your cholesterol is a bit elevated, 200 is\n\n[37:38] norm, or anything below is good, your is 205, whatever. But as you can see here, it's really\n\n[37:43] about the optimal values. So the norm values are being left out in that sense and the optimal\n\n[37:52] values for that specific patient at this specific point of time is being listed. And those that are\n\n[37:57] influenceable can be then modified with the help of doctor to reduce or increase those. And what\n\n[38:05] was very useful is the fact that we can repeat those tests, not every week, not every month,\n\n[38:12] but it's reasonable to repeat them like every three months. If you want to really intervene\n\n[38:16] and have somebody have a change and do something, we have the longitudinal follow up. And this was\n\n[38:23] a patient who was actually in August, 38 biologically, and then it increased to 44,\n\n[38:30] literally within half a year. And what happened here, the patient started to actually take quite\n\n[38:35] a bit of supplements. Oh, we might mention which ones, but let's say the dose was triple as high\n\n[38:40] as what would usually be recommended on the supplements, thinking that more is better,\n\n[38:45] but actually very often in medicine we say less is more. So this patient's injury listens,\n\n[38:51] he didn't want to stop the supplements, he continued. And after we measured like another\n\n[38:55] half a year later, he went up and then he started to listen and to reduce and two things\n\n[39:00] to stop. And then the biological age actually went down. That was very good. But it's really\n\n[39:06] a work one-on-one with the patient and it is scalable as we can see already with the public\n\n[39:13] departments. It's scalable. It's of course less general, but it's scalable. And it's all about\n\n[39:20] guide the right guidance where the continuous monitoring is very helpful, more detailed\n\n[39:27] diagnostic on a larger scale and really also finding the right medication and or supplements\n\n[39:32] for the patient in specific intervals. Now, therefore we can follow up.\n\n[39:40] I know that we have about 13 minutes left. Oh, okay. Thank you for that. We were chatting in\n\n[39:47] upfront to make sure that I'm not going over time, which I'm apologizing for. I usually I do.\n\n[39:52] So we can really longitudinal follow up the patient and see biologically where the patient\n\n[39:57] is standing. And there are also a few special cases for those who are interested. Sometimes we see\n\n[40:03] a patient, this is just an example of a patient who was chronologically 29th, a female had a\n\n[40:09] problem to get pregnant for no really apparent reasons. Hormones were okay. Everything was fine.\n\n[40:15] Structurally, gynecologically everything was fine. No children. So when we measure the biological\n\n[40:20] age, I just said, you know, out of let's just do it. Let's see what's going on. And she went\n\n[40:24] biologically 31. You might say the Delta is not very big, but actually for a patient at this age\n\n[40:29] for that specific algorithm, it's a lot. And we know that patients who are being getting a Delta\n\n[40:37] that is higher very often and they do not have apparent blood parameters that make them older.\n\n[40:44] So everything is within the norm, very often have autoimmune diseases. And indeed for that\n\n[40:49] patient was the case actually, it was more of a beginner. So clearly she was, you know, she had\n\n[40:54] great difficulty to get a child. So again, see things can be detected more than just, you know,\n\n[41:01] saying this is suboptimal and you can improve. And maybe just for the closure, things that are\n\n[41:09] really passionate, that they're very passionate about. And I think that this will re-advance the\n\n[41:15] field is AI based drug discovery without making promotion for Ensilico, but they are the leaders\n\n[41:21] you might have seen the nature biotech paper that just came out two weeks ago about the first\n\n[41:26] drug that was AI discovered and is now in phase 2B within like less under 18 months, which usually\n\n[41:34] takes years and billions. Anyways, so this AI based drugs are very interesting because, because\n\n[41:41] they are using so much data power, they can actually not only focus on the disease,\n\n[41:48] but they also can integrate another function. So they have like a dual target. They can target\n\n[41:55] a specific disease, a gene or, you know, some kindness, some enzyme, but on top of that,\n\n[42:00] do something else. So for example, the drug that was mentioned there is a drug pro-fibrosis\n\n[42:06] developed for IPA, you know, idiopathic pulmonic fibrosis, very deadly, a horrible disease where\n\n[42:12] there is no cure. We can only manage it and put it into a chronic state. This drug is actually\n\n[42:19] reversing, but it's also reversing fibrosis, which is one of the main side effects of aging.\n\n[42:25] So that is very interesting. And again, it's extremely scalable because what is happening is\n\n[42:29] huge AI robotic labs, which have zero people in it, only the robot, they can be miniaturized\n\n[42:37] and placed in the hospitals. So me as a doctor, if I have my patients, I also work as an oncologist.\n\n[42:43] So if I have my patient and they can take a tissue and I can just send it to the robot,\n\n[42:47] that will do the high output analysis and fuel it into a database that is connected all over the\n\n[42:53] world. With my patients, I might find number one, old targets and find the right medicine for my\n\n[42:59] patient, which is a very easy thing right now to do. But secondly, maybe I can find a new target\n\n[43:05] and somebody else had this target as well and we can potentially create a new drug that can we use.\n\n[43:13] So again, how can we bridge the sick care and the new wave of healthy longevity medicine\n\n[43:21] by actually doing? As I mentioned before, we already had a healthy longevity department in\n\n[43:27] several hospitals, but at the same time, there are also hospitals that are 100% sick care hospitals\n\n[43:34] and it's the one that they're working, for example, in China that is transforming on a little bit of\n\n[43:39] a different level because the amount of people is much higher. And what we are doing there is\n\n[43:46] basically building a sort of smart hospital because integration of data in that specific setting\n\n[43:53] is the most important across the globe. With this, I'm going to finish up thanking you for your\n\n[44:01] attention and very open for any questions and discussion. Thank you so much. You cover a really\n\n[44:10] wide range there. That's really helpful and congrats on all of these efforts. I don't know\n\n[44:14] how you possibly could have time for all of this. Thank you. Okay, we have Karl here with his first\n\n[44:21] question. I was waiting for quite some time and if you want to drop your questions in the chat,\n\n[44:25] you're welcome to do so or feel free to raise your hand at this point as well.\n\n[44:29] Very expansive, impressive effort. Obviously, the world needs better education of all the positions\n\n[44:36] on things that are going on in the field that we know and love. So my question is about\n\n[44:41] standard of care. You talked a lot about expansion and diagnostics and stuff, but\n\n[44:48] Nala, and I've heard lots of stuff about the whole effort from you and from Andrea, but I hardly ever\n\n[44:54] hear anything about what the actual advice and standard of care being advocated is. What are we\n\n[45:03] teaching? Who's deciding on what standard of care for longevity medicine is? And I think\n\n[45:11] that's one of the things that we've been talking about for a long time is we want it to be more\n\n[45:17] than what normal doctors are trained on. And there are some consensus from the aging research field,\n\n[45:24] but there's also a lot of controversies and things that we don't know. And yet, individual\n\n[45:28] doctors are making their own recommendations in some of these areas. So how is the society deciding\n\n[45:35] and advocate as standard of care in this area? Is there a plan for, especially for the controversial\n\n[45:41] things where researchers disagree? And is there a plan for some kind of broader global conversation\n\n[45:47] to decide on what it should be in the areas as we get more data? Or is that something that you\n\n[45:53] and the other leaders of the movement see as more appropriate to happen behind closed doors?\n\n[45:59] I hear you. And answer to your last question for sure, no. And I also don't think a society\n\n[46:06] can or is in place to decide anything. At this very moment, I think the society can only facilitate\n\n[46:13] the effort to bring whatever is out there proposed as potential standard of care to higher councils\n\n[46:21] and discuss with them what potentially can be done. But since this will take a long time,\n\n[46:27] therefore, many of you might have heard and we also among our members and broadly we said we want\n\n[46:34] to create the working group about the guidelines, but it's not something that will happen immediately\n\n[46:39] and nobody in my personal opinion here is in a position to say this is the standard of care.\n\n[46:45] One can recommend and this is why I mentioned at the beginning that guidelines have to start\n\n[46:51] with guidelines, how to build guidelines in this field. And this can be only done with\n\n[46:57] test scores with close collaboration with the councils that have been done doing this for other\n\n[47:03] disciplines for decades. And then only after that can recommendations come as recommendations,\n\n[47:10] the lowest level of evidence and from that guidance. For me, that will take years. Therefore,\n\n[47:16] I think and definitely nothing should be happening in any field in my opinion behind closed doors.\n\n[47:22] But on top of that, I think we also need to do things already on maximum credible level.\n\n[47:30] The public setting, for example, here, of course, we understand that using some of the biological\n\n[47:35] aging clocks might not be in the standard evidence base, but we will. So that's why we do it as a\n\n[47:41] study, right? Every patient who is coming to the center is also a part of a study. And I guess\n\n[47:48] that's very important and we'll be showing what later will be the recommendations in the guidelines.\n\n[47:55] Thanks.\n\n[47:56] Oh, we have Larry.\n\n[47:59] Yeah, hi. I think it was a great presentation. And I think for patients who can\n\n[48:04] undergo the type of individualized therapy you're recommending, it could be beneficial.\n\n[48:10] The problem is, that was touched on just recently, is coordination of clinical trials,\n\n[48:18] coordination of clinical information. That was the huge problem with COVID is that there are all\n\n[48:23] kinds of clinical trials started, but no information came out of them. And I think in longevity,\n\n[48:28] that's a little bit where they're at now. There's a lot of things going on. There isn't\n\n[48:33] much coordination of effort. I heard Ray Curzell was on a podcast. He's taking 80 pills. I don't\n\n[48:41] know, maybe some of them are helping him, maybe some aren't, but there's a lot of this stuff\n\n[48:44] going forward already without very little evidence behind it. Vitamin D, there's some evidence that\n\n[48:51] prevents cancer. There's also evidence that it might cause heart problems. A lot of these things\n\n[48:57] to really get the real answer for which people they'll be beneficial for, it's a bit complicated,\n\n[49:04] but if you don't coordinate studies, we're just going to be at the same place we are 10 years from\n\n[49:10] now when people are taking all kinds of things and nobody knows what really works. And there's all\n\n[49:15] kinds of biomarkers out there and some are contradictory to each other as well. And I think\n\n[49:21] the important thing are simple studies that improve people's lives. And I don't know if you\n\n[49:26] need the depth of study that you're doing for that. So first of all, thanks for mentioning many\n\n[49:32] aspects. And I guess, again, I can speak for me personally, but I know that many people share it\n\n[49:37] and I'm actually going to quote Dr. Cran here, coordination and collaboration, I think, is\n\n[49:42] tremendously important. Most of the clinical trials that are running in oncology, for example,\n\n[49:47] are not exactly coordinated in a way that everybody will need to report to everybody\n\n[49:52] how to do it. There are no massive consortia, but there is a coordination because people\n\n[49:57] talk to each other much more than we can because it's already an established discipline and there's\n\n[50:02] a little bit of a different exchange and there are guidelines that cannot be crossed paths.\n\n[50:06] We are starting something new. I like to compare this to interventional radiology,\n\n[50:11] discipline that became very successful in a very short period of time. But if you look up for\n\n[50:16] guidelines in interventional radiology, you will not find much, right? But still it's working,\n\n[50:20] it's working very well. So I think coordination is important, but without over regulation.\n\n[50:28] And at the same time, I think it's also important to exchange data more. So rather than just\n\n[50:36] coordinate, also exchange. And yes, of course, there are plenty of potential biomarkers out\n\n[50:42] there that have been published already since the last decade. I think the consortia that are out\n\n[50:47] there, which I'm a big fan of, is their role in the way to at least give us a way to validate that,\n\n[50:55] even within clinical trials. But one thing I didn't have time to talk about and which I think is a\n\n[51:00] very important key point in longevity medicine, and hopefully it will be done much more, is the N\n\n[51:07] equals one clinical trial, which is not the same as trying out and anecdotal, but really N1\n\n[51:15] clinical trial in the setting. I think we will learn a lot from this as well.\n\n[51:21] Lila So Wonderful. We unfortunately only have one minute left. And so I always wanted to finish on\n\n[51:27] the note of if people are excited about your work and with what you work, many different efforts,\n\n[51:33] how can they learn more? How can they get in touch? Is there anything in particular\n\n[51:36] as a research collaboration or something that you're looking for that people can help with?\n\n[51:40] Lila I don't have a website or something, but I'm on LinkedIn and I'm extremely,\n\n[51:45] hopefully extremely responsive. And I always am always happy about collaborations, extremely\n\n[51:51] much so in terms of clinical trials. And if somebody's working on longevity education,\n\n[51:56] as in clinical councils, medical councils, or somebody's working on clinical trials with\n\n[52:02] repurposed drugs, with liceanalytic drug protectors, always have been very happy to collaborate\n\n[52:07] and AI. So if there are platforms that are aiming at integrating, then always also very welcome.\n\n[52:16] And in general, always happy to connect. Lila Wonderful. Thank you so much. I'm\n\n[52:21] really happy that we finally got to work. Thanks a lot for taking some time out of\n\n[52:24] your really busy schedule. Lila Thank you so much for having me.\n\n[52:27] Lila It's a great honor and pleasure. Lila Thanks everyone for joining and for\n\n[52:31] your great questions. And I hope to see you all very soon. Have a wonderful rest of your day. Bye, everyone."

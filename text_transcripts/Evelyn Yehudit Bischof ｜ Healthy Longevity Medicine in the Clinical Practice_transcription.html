  <pre class="transcript"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=0s">[00:00]</a> Hi everyone, welcome to Fawzi's Biotech and Health Extension group.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=3s">[00:03]</a> I'm really excited to finally have Ivelin Bishop here today with us.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=7s">[00:07]</a> We've been in contact with you for years now, on and off, we've been trying to schedule something.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=12s">[00:12]</a> We're really excited about your work and you've been definitely really wrapping it up over the past few years.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=17s">[00:17]</a> So I think it's a really great time to have you on.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=19s">[00:19]</a> Today you will be discussing in the group about healthy longevity medicine in the clinical practice,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=26s">[00:26]</a> which is definitely a topic that I think has become rather of interest lately.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=31s">[00:31]</a> So I'm really excited for the Q&A afterwards.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=34s">[00:34]</a> I'm sure people have lots of questions and comments and contributing similar efforts.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=38s">[00:38]</a> So without further ado, thank you so so much for joining.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=41s">[00:41]</a> I'll share a lot more about you in the chat, but for now, please take it away.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=44s">[00:44]</a> I'm very excited to have you.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=46s">[00:46]</a> Thank you so much. It's a great honor and pleasure to be here and I'm great for this opportunity.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=51s">[00:51]</a> And really congratulations to the Forsyth Institute to do it and to do it on such a scale.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=58s">[00:58]</a> I will share my slides and of course, very much looking forward to the Q&A session,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=64s">[01:04]</a> which is usually much more engaging and valuable.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=68s">[01:08]</a> When I was choosing that topic, I tried to be a little bit broader because I would like to not only discuss,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=73s">[01:13]</a> you know, whatever people already discussed in terms of the clinicians and in terms of what we want to do with health,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=79s">[01:19]</a> span versus lifespan versus the theory for the clinic that we know.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=84s">[01:24]</a> I just really wanted to talk a little bit about practical examples of what is already being done across the globe

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=91s">[01:31]</a> and then really to say what is planned as in agenda by specific societies or groups.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=99s">[01:39]</a> So I would nevertheless love to start with an announcement and warm invitation to the ERDD conference.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=107s">[01:47]</a> This year, it's the 11th time that it will take place in Copenhagen.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=112s">[01:52]</a> It's, I guess, by now one of the largest aging and longevity conferences.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=117s">[01:57]</a> And since COVID, basically, we also have an integrated time specific slot for longevity medicine session.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=126s">[02:06]</a> It grew from a workshop to half a day to last year, a full day, the opening day.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=132s">[02:12]</a> And this year it expands further and it will be a whole longevity medicine track.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=137s">[02:17]</a> So it will be the full first day.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=139s">[02:19]</a> And on top of that, also other tracks along the entire conference.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=144s">[02:24]</a> Longevity medicine track will really accommodate for the clinical part and allow not only clinical discussion,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=150s">[02:30]</a> clinical trial discussions and really have a platform for doctors and healthcare professionals and affiliates to discuss various topics.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=160s">[02:40]</a> And usually we also have a co-moderator that graciously allows us to co-host the day.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=167s">[02:47]</a> Last year it was Michael Baxson from Nature Medicine.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=170s">[02:50]</a> Before that was Nature Aging.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=171s">[02:51]</a> Before that was National Health Longevity.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=173s">[02:53]</a> This year it will be revealed a little bit later.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=175s">[02:55]</a> But one thing I can already reveal is that this year conference will be also co-organized, more or less,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=183s">[03:03]</a> or will be also done partially in partnership with Express HealthSpan.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=188s">[03:08]</a> And especially with Jamie, where we are structuring the first day of Longevity Medicine Day,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=194s">[03:14]</a> a little bit together to be more aligned with hand in hand,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=197s">[03:17]</a> since Express HealthSpan is really focusing on how can we do something for the patient

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=203s">[03:23]</a> and how can you bring the research to the clinic.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=207s">[03:27]</a> So this will be also the time where the endpoints will be announced and the guidelines of the prize.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=215s">[03:35]</a> And another that I want to mention that I usually always mention in my presentation,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=219s">[03:39]</a> but here I would also like to make a few announcements.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=222s">[03:42]</a> And whoever is interested to join and collaborate, everybody is always welcome, is the Longevity Education Hub.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=229s">[03:49]</a> So talking about HealthSpan, healthy longevity medicine, whatever we want to do,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=234s">[03:54]</a> I think the first step is always education of physicians, education of healthcare professionals and others.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=240s">[04:00]</a> But myself, I only know medicine.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=243s">[04:03]</a> So I was focusing on the education of the doctors and we created Longevity Education Hub,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=249s">[04:09]</a> which is offering free courses that are CME accredited by the AAMCA for introduction and then also expanded course.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=260s">[04:20]</a> And doctors who pass the quiz over 80% can also get the CME accreditation.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=265s">[04:25]</a> And still, now for the past four years,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=268s">[04:28]</a> we have been accessing still the only course that CME accredited globally for longevity medicine,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=273s">[04:33]</a> which is a very nice thing because we went to build national chapters.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=278s">[04:38]</a> And I think we have right now about 10 chapters covering 80% of the globe,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=282s">[04:42]</a> both Spanish with Chinese with Arabic courses.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=286s">[04:46]</a> And the thing that really was in our long term vision, which is starting right now,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=291s">[04:51]</a> is to bring this curriculum into men's schools and also into all residences and fellowships,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=297s">[04:57]</a> so really the last part, the practical part of the education of the doctors before they become specialists.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=304s">[05:04]</a> So that we can really advance the field and bring more clinicians into the field.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=310s">[05:10]</a> And the dream is really to have medical students finish in med school knowing what is really longevity,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=316s">[05:16]</a> knowing the mechanisms of aging and not to learn them as they go and mostly they have no time to learn it later.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=323s">[05:23]</a> So those two big announcements before I move on and usually I always start with this slide

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=330s">[05:30]</a> because for me until it changes, it always reflects longevity medicine.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=334s">[05:34]</a> So I started from Alice in Wonderland, so they are running with the Red Queen.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=339s">[05:39]</a> And after running very fast, they stop and they are in the same place.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=342s">[05:42]</a> And, you know, Alice is asking why are we in the same place and the Queen is saying

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=346s">[05:46]</a> that she won't actually advance, she has to run double as fast.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=349s">[05:49]</a> And that's pretty much what healthy longevity is for me.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=352s">[05:52]</a> So we are constantly running because there is just so much knowledge from neuroscience, from AI, from computing.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=358s">[05:58]</a> Now with generative AI, we're really becoming a mainstream.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=361s">[06:01]</a> And at the same time, we really also want to advance.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=364s">[06:04]</a> So that's a full-time job and a little bit more since, again, we do not have healthy longevity medicine yet as a separate discipline.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=373s">[06:13]</a> So those who actually practice it usually have also another foot somewhere else in their own home disciplines.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=382s">[06:22]</a> Or they do this, but then it's very difficult to integrate it into the typical healthcare setting that we have right now,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=391s">[06:31]</a> the healthcare systems.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=393s">[06:33]</a> And that's a little bit of a problem because it then remains something relatively closed.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=399s">[06:39]</a> But before we go into that, I would just like to mention how the definition of healthy longevity medicine

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=405s">[06:45]</a> or longevity medicine has been evolving.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=408s">[06:48]</a> And it basically started a little bit in the year 2021 with the publication in Nature Aging

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=413s">[06:53]</a> based on the ERDD presentation of Dr. Kai Fuli saying that longevity medicine is basically

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=420s">[07:00]</a> AI-based precision medicine focusing on the health span and the lifespan.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=424s">[07:04]</a> It was pretty much the first time that somebody said it and published it in this way.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=430s">[07:10]</a> So it's not only the lifespan, primarily the health span.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=433s">[07:13]</a> And this is powered by AI technology.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=436s">[07:16]</a> Here we meant mostly the biological aging clock.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=439s">[07:19]</a> The definition has been transformed a little bit when healthy longevity medicine society was found.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=447s">[07:27]</a> Some of you might know it.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=448s">[07:28]</a> It is a society that is actually creating a platform to further bring longevity medicine

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=456s">[07:36]</a> into the field as a sub-discipline, probably first a sub-discipline under internal medicine,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=463s">[07:43]</a> which also of course includes family medicine and then to hopefully also separate disciplinary

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=471s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=471s">[07:51]</a></a> or net.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=471s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=471s">[07:51]</a></a> Definitely it has to be positioned as something where the doctors can be certified,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=476s">[07:56]</a> can be educated, certified, qualified properly, and also have the way to have the so-called

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=482s">[08:02]</a> continuous, continued education to always be on top of their knowledge.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=487s">[08:07]</a> And this society, when we first came together in the executive committee,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=492s">[08:12]</a> we were thinking long time and discussing brainstorming and came up with the definition

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=498s">[08:18]</a> that healthy longevity medicine, actually this healthy came on top of longevity medicine as we

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=503s">[08:23]</a> were talking to really distinct ourselves a little bit from what longevity medicine

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=508s">[08:28]</a> partially became along the years.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=511s">[08:31]</a> And instead, the definition will be optimizing health span along the lifespan by targeting

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=518s">[08:38]</a> age-related processes.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=519s">[08:39]</a> So really, including the fact that we are working on age-related processes rather than

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=527s">[08:47]</a> on aged populations, of course we learned from them a lot, but it's not only the thing and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=534s">[08:54]</a> it's a health span target across the entire lifespan.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=538s">[08:58]</a> That's the committee.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=540s">[09:00]</a> Here I just wanted to mention that many familiar faces, but one face might not be so familiar,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=546s">[09:06]</a> Professor Harold Pimpus, who is a psychiatrist.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=548s">[09:08]</a> He's the head of Psych at Columbia and Presbyterian.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=551s">[09:11]</a> And this is just to say that in healthy longevity medicine very often, we don't forget and we

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=558s">[09:18]</a> will always keep in mind that brain cognition and also mental health is very important,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=564s">[09:24]</a> but actually to practically have that integrated into a healthy longevity medicine society,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=569s">[09:29]</a> I found that very important and I was very happy that this happened.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=575s">[09:35]</a> Now, as we are talking about bringing health and longevity medicine into the mainstream

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=580s">[09:40]</a> healthcare, into something that can really be practiced, we need several things.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=586s">[09:46]</a> Of course, it's a puzzle, but we have to start somewhere.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=589s">[09:49]</a> And we started with a bunch of white papers.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=592s">[09:52]</a> Actually, our most recent paper was out a week ago or something.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=597s">[09:57]</a> It's called Building Longevity Departments in Public Clinical Settings.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=603s">[10:03]</a> You can look it up in Geoscience, which is actually telling about how did we, as the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=609s">[10:09]</a> working group of HLMS, which is constituted of Mayo and US and Sheba Israel, how we came

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=618s">[10:18]</a> towards building longevity departments in public settings from building the team to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=624s">[10:24]</a> educating healthcare professionals to finding the budgets, to finding the right diagnostics,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=629s">[10:29]</a> of course, and to also interventions that are already being done for those patients

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=634s">[10:34]</a> who are coming to the departments in the public setting.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=638s">[10:38]</a> But then also we will hopefully very soon have a paper on the actual definition

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=642s">[10:42]</a> of longevity medicine and then for the white people to be coming now.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=648s">[10:48]</a> Of course, we immediately jumped on education.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=652s">[10:52]</a> Since the beginning of August 2022, we already had our monthly case discussions in HLMS where

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=661s">[11:01]</a> not only medical doctors, but healthcare professionals and affiliates were able to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=667s">[11:07]</a> really discuss cases.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=668s">[11:08]</a> We didn't want to call it case presentations because we all do not have yet binding guidelines

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=675s">[11:15]</a> and recommendations for healthy longevity medicine as in clinical setting.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=680s">[11:20]</a> But it was important for us to have a platform to discuss among those who actually practice it

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=686s">[11:26]</a> or who are planning to practice.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=689s">[11:29]</a> That is still happening.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=690s">[11:30]</a> But a very important overarching goal is really to create guidelines for longevity medicine

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=698s">[11:38]</a> and quality controls for doctors and for clinics.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=703s">[11:43]</a> Have a set of as it is done for any other discipline and as it is done in any other

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=708s">[11:48]</a> setting where clinics and doctors have to be undergoing quality control or ongoing

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=714s">[11:54]</a> pain sick and also where a discipline has a set of clear guidelines.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=719s">[11:59]</a> This is something that we want to achieve.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=721s">[12:01]</a> This has to start first with building guidelines and how to build guidelines for longevity

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=726s">[12:06]</a> medicine, which is very different than in any other discipline that is focusing on sick care.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=733s">[12:13]</a> Not only because of the ICD coding that is very different and focused on pathologies,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=738s">[12:18]</a> of course, but also because at this very moment there is just not enough evidence in clinical

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=745s">[12:25]</a> trials and many things.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=746s">[12:26]</a> One would say then how can you build guidelines?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=748s">[12:28]</a> Well, we would start, of course, as always with the lowest level of guidance, which are

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=753s">[12:33]</a> recommendations, just three or C, whoever wants to call it which way, and then to build

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=759s">[12:39]</a> it up towards guidelines.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=761s">[12:41]</a> Guidelines, both in interventions and in diagnostics.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=765s">[12:45]</a> Of course, we have to start to diagnostics because the most important thing right now

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=770s">[12:50]</a> for the success of clinical trials is the definition of the right end points and those

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=777s">[12:57]</a> are the biomarkers of aging.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=779s">[12:59]</a> Luckily, within the last almost two years now we have consortium of aging biomarkers,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=786s">[13:06]</a> both the aging biomarker consortium in the US but also big biomarker consortium in China

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=793s">[13:13]</a> and both of them are doing a great job to build it up.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=797s">[13:17]</a> Here just to show once again where are in the world already longevity, I like to say

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=803s">[13:23]</a> longevity departments.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=804s">[13:24]</a> One might say longevity centers where people can come and undergo some level of longevity

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=812s">[13:32]</a> diagnostics for our center here in Shiba.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=816s">[13:36]</a> It's fully for free and we will have this year 1,500 people who will undergo 360 screening

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=823s">[13:43]</a> for longevity at baseline six months and then 12 months.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=827s">[13:47]</a> All of those people would be in the study.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=829s">[13:49]</a> 80% would be randomizing to interventions and would be given or are given interventions

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=835s">[13:55]</a> for a year to come and then there will be a crossover.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=838s">[13:58]</a> On the one hand, that's already a service for people coming from across the country

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=844s">[14:04]</a> to be screened but at the same time, of course, the end points which will include the biomarkers

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=849s">[14:09]</a> but also compliance will hopefully be something that can be presented to health insurances

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=858s">[14:18]</a> to say it actually makes sense by the economical calculation to implement some sort of program

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=864s">[14:24]</a> in the packages and to have people giving the accessibility to such longevity services.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=873s">[14:33]</a> Overall, of course, it's an ongoing learning and as we are learning and translating healthy

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=878s">[14:38]</a> longevity medicine, I think almost every month we are adding something new into the center,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=883s">[14:43]</a> being from a new technology for diagnostics to some new flocks that are out there,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=888s">[14:48]</a> new signatures for methylation. That's extremely fun to do and beautiful but at the same time,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=895s">[14:55]</a> really this tertiary digital layer of the patient expands. It's a lot of data.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=900s">[15:00]</a> It's a huge amount of data and it's a data lake that is hard to handle in clinics that are

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=907s">[15:07]</a> primed for significant care that have been in the system for years and decades and more.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=912s">[15:12]</a> And so the EHR really has to expand in a way that only a center that is really open-minded can do,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=922s">[15:22]</a> which is very interesting. And of course, without AI, it's impossible. So it's very important once

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=931s">[15:31]</a> a center has decided to be a longevity center and be at a scale that goes into thousands rather than

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=939s">[15:39]</a> hundreds. It's very important to have besides the strong IT in the background, besides the strong

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=946s">[15:46]</a> data lake capacity in the background, also an AI arm that can fuel in all this information

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=953s">[15:53]</a> continuously and hopefully be connected to something that is teaching a very large LLM.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=960s">[16:00]</a> So large language models, I think, in health and longevity medicine as we speak are being trained.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=965s">[16:05]</a> AI is learning constantly. There are big transformers being conducted and done.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=971s">[16:11]</a> Some of the publications are already even available. I will show them in a moment.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=977s">[16:17]</a> And one has to think about that as a doctor who is creating such a or running such a department

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=982s">[16:22]</a> to have this in the background. So what one can see on the surface, all the testings, all the center,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=989s">[16:29]</a> equipment, all the doctors who are there as they usually would be. The power is in the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=995s">[16:35]</a> backside. The power is in the AI that is behind it. And I think we are seeing really a constant

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1003s">[16:43]</a> revolution of what the field is. So when we tried to do a timeline, we saw there was quite a fast

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1012s">[16:52]</a> progress in general up until the year 2015. We had the Hallmarks of Aging, the Seminar

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1019s">[16:59]</a> publication, we had the Harvard Clock, which was for me personally a huge revolution. I remember

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1025s">[17:05]</a> learning at the med school and it really transformed and shifted our minds of doctors from telomeres.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1032s">[17:12]</a> There might be something more in terms of aging. There's something more that controls it. And there

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1037s">[17:17]</a> was also CRISP coming up. Then really the biggest point came, I think, in the year 2015,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1043s">[17:23]</a> where we started to see more and more AI in medicine and all the comics revolution came on.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1049s">[17:29]</a> And then also deep aging clocks were coming. And this is thanks to the fact that around this time,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1055s">[17:35]</a> the deep neural networks were developed and really applied in order to really have the data

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1062s">[17:42]</a> analyzed first structured and then analyzed in a way that would bring a sanctionable objective out

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1069s">[17:49]</a> this something that is usable, such as biological age. And then the wearables came. So

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1078s">[17:58]</a> healthy longevity medicine without wearables and very good integration of those wearables

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1084s">[18:04]</a> in the API and daily use is impossible. So it's very important to use it.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1091s">[18:11]</a> And then the clinical trials and supplements came and more and more. Until now, even as I mentioned,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1098s">[18:18]</a> we have large-handwich models, we have transformers that are being built. And that's something that I'm

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1104s">[18:24]</a> extremely excited about. Actually, healthy longevity medicine has been using generative

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1108s">[18:28]</a> AI for a long time. It was just not as accessible to people until CHEP GPT came out. But it was

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1117s">[18:37]</a> already being announced and everything that's generative AI was allowing us to use was already

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1122s">[18:42]</a> being applied in order to, as I mentioned before, be able to integrate structure and analyze the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1131s">[18:51]</a> at large scale longitudinally, but also data that is really extremely heterogeneous and multimodal.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1139s">[18:59]</a> Because for healthy longevity medicine, we have to go from the omics to the systems,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1143s">[19:03]</a> through the organs, neptests, radiomics, actually at this point of time, historical records,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1150s">[19:10]</a> very deep anonymistic records, and so on. Up until the point that we also tried to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1157s">[19:17]</a> get as much data points as possible from the epigenetics. So from the environment,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1161s">[19:21]</a> the influences on the person themselves that actually changed the epigenome. And that was only

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1168s">[19:28]</a> possible with the learning methods that allowed us to get some sort of objective function out of

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1175s">[19:35]</a> it. The objective function mostly was personalized medicine, advice, recommendation, and right now,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1181s">[19:41]</a> much more, for example, AI based drugs, which we'll talk about just in a moment.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1187s">[19:47]</a> Now, as I mentioned, deep neural networks were tremendously important for that to happen, but

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1196s">[19:56]</a> also other versions of learning. There are good sources to learn about that there's actually a

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1202s">[20:02]</a> chapter in the book called AI and longevity medicine that is talking much more deeper about

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1208s">[20:08]</a> federal learning and transfer learning that were used in order to get what you call today biological

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1215s">[20:15]</a> aging clocks, but also other personalized recommendations. And as I mentioned before,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1221s">[20:21]</a> generative AI and longevity medicine has been used already before really to integrate all the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1226s">[20:26]</a> sets from those very different data points, extremely heterogeneous through the neural networks

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1232s">[20:32]</a> into something that is actionable for a clinic. For example, what is the aging pathway that is being

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1237s">[20:37]</a> targeted? What are the synthetic data out of it? What are the potential trackable targets? How to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1244s">[20:44]</a> build a track out of this information? So that was already happening. Now going out of the deep AI,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1254s">[20:54]</a> how does it translate to an actual practice? What can we do? And how is longevity medicine

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1260s">[21:00]</a> different from prevention? How is it different or how does it fit into also our reactive medicine

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1268s">[21:08]</a> reality? So I don't claim that this is the right way to see it. For me, it just helps to see it

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1275s">[21:15]</a> this way that first we have reactive medicine and it will not disappear for seenables. We treat

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1281s">[21:21]</a> diseases, we react to a disease and that's important and basically any doctor has to know

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1287s">[21:27]</a> how to do that. Then there is prevention, prevention from primary to tertiary prevention.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1292s">[21:32]</a> It's a proactive approach, we detect early diseases. So therefore the disease is already there or

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1297s">[21:37]</a> early recurrence, right? But there is already a pathology that we detect and we detect early

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1302s">[21:42]</a> in order to remove and treat that pathology. So that's also great and that's very well established

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1306s">[21:46]</a> there are clear guidelines and that's very important. Now what's different in healthy

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1310s">[21:50]</a> longevity medicine? Depending on the scale how it's being done, it can encompass also prevention

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1316s">[21:56]</a> or be an additional part to prevention. I think both are totally okay. And for example, for us,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1323s">[22:03]</a> we separate, right? We have a specific order center that is doing prevention with all the screenings,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1329s">[22:09]</a> with colonoscopies, mammographies and others. And we do the extras, right? From the functional

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1334s">[22:14]</a> testing to the methylation to biological age and so on. But there are centers that integrate both,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1341s">[22:21]</a> also fine, that goes hand in hand, but it's so different. And in this part, really longevity

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1348s">[22:28]</a> medicine is about detecting the risk of developing a disease and trying to assess the gravity or the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1355s">[22:35]</a> dimension of that specific risk for a specific patient and bring the patient from current status

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1362s">[22:42]</a> of different markers to the optimal status of those markers in order to optimize the health

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1369s">[22:49]</a> span. And I'm probably repeating myself and I'm talking to the experts here, but nevertheless,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1374s">[22:54]</a> I think it has to be said, we are extending our life expectancy tremendously fast and it has

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1381s">[23:01]</a> expanded in the past hundred years, but the health span didn't extend at the same speed and therefore

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1387s">[23:07]</a> we have the gap. And so healthy longevity medicine is really trying to close that gap.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1393s">[23:13]</a> And so primarily it's really not about further extending the lifespan. For some people, it is,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1398s">[23:18]</a> you know, by product that is desirable, which is great, that's the desire, but it's really about

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1405s">[23:25]</a> closing the gap of health span and lifespan and extending the healthy years of life. So basically

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1413s">[23:33]</a> age and disease or death with good health. And because the definition is optimizing health span

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1424s">[23:44]</a> along with lifespan, we are talking about also really optimizing a point of life that we could

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1433s">[23:53]</a> call a peak performance or peak individual performance. Basically in normal real world

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1440s">[24:00]</a> scenario in medicine and beyond, we would look at patient's chronological age along the lifespan

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1447s">[24:07]</a> of a patient and we would see that the patient is going, you know, to a curve of life. I'm sure you've

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1453s">[24:13]</a> seen that before in different places that's actually taken from the Nature Aging publication.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1458s">[24:18]</a> So we basically see a patient who is, you know, being born and until the adolescent is being

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1464s">[24:24]</a> usually guided by one or two doctors, neonatologists, pediatricians, and we all know

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1471s">[24:31]</a> the norms. So everything is very normative. There are ranges by chronological age. A child has to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1477s">[24:37]</a> achieve this and this and that within a specific age. That's basically how it's being done.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1483s">[24:43]</a> Until the person is reaching this level, which is that peak individual performance, this is usually

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1489s">[24:49]</a> a short interval of our life where we have the top functionality of our body and mind.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1495s">[24:55]</a> And from that moment on, it's a functional decline at different pace for different people.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1502s">[25:02]</a> And usually this is also where different doctors are evaluating the person within norms that are

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1510s">[25:10]</a> mostly based on chronological age, but not only, but these are the norms. We have the normative

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1515s">[25:15]</a> values and they are, you know, we usually in the clinic, we love what's outside the norm,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1520s">[25:20]</a> what's within the norm. And then we try to act if needed or if possible. And that's pretty much it.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1529s">[25:29]</a> Of course there are limitations because doctors' memory is extremely limited and there is a

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1533s">[25:33]</a> dispersion. You know, if there's two or three doctors looking at the case, there will always be

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1539s">[25:39]</a> a problem to bring everybody together at the same point. So there is a lot of information that is

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1546s">[25:46]</a> leaking and usually that leaked information is not beneficial for the patient outcome. So the decline

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1552s">[25:52]</a> is going towards very often a very comorbid or multi-morbid end of life.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1559s">[25:59]</a> Now in health and longevity medicine, as you can see, it's not a tremendously extended lifespan

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1566s">[26:06]</a> here. So the length of life, the years of life might say the same or maybe a little longer,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1571s">[26:11]</a> again, buying product. What we are really trying to focus here is to have the patient being as

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1577s">[26:17]</a> close as possible to patient's personal, individual peak performance. So how we do that? We are trying

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1588s">[26:28]</a> our best to develop and to use biological aging clocks and really to evaluate the patient with

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1594s">[26:34]</a> algorithms that are trying to tell us not only how old the patient is biologically at a specific

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1600s">[26:40]</a> point of time, but also what would be the optimal biological age of that patient at that specific

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1608s">[26:48]</a> point of time and which parameters need to be fixed in order to bring that patient back.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1616s">[26:56]</a> And for this, of course, we are mostly using longitudinal data. I usually tell patients

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1622s">[27:02]</a> I usually tell patients, please do share with me anything that you have from your old data,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1628s">[27:08]</a> simply because the more the better and the more longitudinal in the past those data points are,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1636s">[27:16]</a> the better the predictions of what can be optimized. And so therefore, longevity medicine

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1643s">[27:23]</a> is really standing on two pillars in my opinion. We have the diagnostics and we have the interventions

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1649s">[27:29]</a> Luckily right now, the intervention part is growing more and more. A few years ago,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1653s">[27:33]</a> it was primarily diagnostics and there was a lot of criticism saying, why do we do all this?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1659s">[27:39]</a> We have nothing that we can really do about it. And the answer was if we don't test

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1666s">[27:46]</a> with this new longevity diagnostic precision medicine, and if we don't fuel it into the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1671s">[27:51]</a> algorithm, we will never be able to find, identify the right endpoints, the right biomarkers for

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1678s">[27:58]</a> clinical trials. And this is exactly what was happening in the past years. And this is why

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1685s">[28:05]</a> luckily we see more and more of those endpoints and biomarkers being validated and therefore useful

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1693s">[28:13]</a> for clinical trials. So finally, we can test which supplements are beneficial for extension

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1698s">[28:18]</a> of health plan and which are not and also repurposed drugs and also hope to be very soon new

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1703s">[28:23]</a> components, both analytics and your protectors and also technologies, right? And to check if

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1711s">[28:31]</a> they are beneficial or not. So what is happening are mostly now as I'm showing now, the longevity

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1717s">[28:37]</a> diagnostic centers, we have a whole fan again, going from either only longevity diagnostics or

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1725s">[28:45]</a> preventative and longevity diagnostics ranging from pulled by the MRIs with overlay AI algorithm

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1734s">[28:54]</a> through other radiomics, through functional tests, through labs, very extensive lab,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1740s">[29:00]</a> and also through wearables and also through more and more liquid biopsies and of course,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1746s">[29:06]</a> omics and microbiome. So microbiomics one could say, and hopefully very soon,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1752s">[29:12]</a> a much bigger panel on biological aging clocks. And what already was established and is now being

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1760s">[29:20]</a> even more important and useful in the clinical practice is the polygenic risk score. So really

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1766s">[29:26]</a> having the mosaic of the genes and saying, not only do you have this and this pathological

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1773s">[29:33]</a> mutation or you're a carrier of this and this disease, which is important, which is good to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1777s">[29:37]</a> have a WGS, but also the polygenic risk score really to see the mosaic of where is the patient

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1783s">[29:43]</a> standing in terms of risk to develop a disease at a specific point of time that is really correlated

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1791s">[29:51]</a> to mortality. So CVS and dementia and their own, so not only cancer and pharmacogenomics. Luckily,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1799s">[29:59]</a> it's really becoming a mainstream and most clinics I've been working with, public setting also have

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1806s">[30:06]</a> pharmacogenomics being done at least once and where we are guiding our treatment,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1812s">[30:12]</a> if a treatment is needed with the help of pharmacogenomics.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1817s">[30:17]</a> And last but not least, of course, wearables. I personally am a big fan of those. I think it's a

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1822s">[30:22]</a> great tool for feedback, but also for the doctor to have the chance to have an instant glimpse of

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1829s">[30:29]</a> continuous monitoring. And besides of the things that we all know from the wearable

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1835s">[30:35]</a> CGNs, all the bands of the rings for the high HRE and all the other vital signs,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1842s">[30:42]</a> I think we are all more and more excited also to have the continuous cholesterol monitors being

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1848s">[30:48]</a> improved and validated, mini polysomnographies in from even of a ring for the night that are giving

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1855s">[30:55]</a> us quite valuable data for the sleep apnea and movement. And last but not least, really a very

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1861s">[31:01]</a> good monitoring of our liquids as in liquid biopsies. So really not only checking in the blood

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1869s">[31:09]</a> for pan cancer panels or cancer panels, CTDNAs or RNAs or CTCs, so circulating tumor cells,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1878s">[31:18]</a> but more and more in liquids or other samples such as stool, such as urine. Stool is very

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1884s">[31:24]</a> established already with the PoloGuard, but not many people know that there are urine tests that

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1889s">[31:29]</a> are testing for prostate and bladder cancer. And hopefully we'll have more and more of those types

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1894s">[31:34]</a> of fluids that can be tested. And of course, also breath, so volatile particles that are also

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1899s">[31:39]</a> predictive of cancer from lung to other endocrine cancers. So I think those things are extremely

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1906s">[31:46]</a> valuable because all of those data points, if they can be integrated properly, will give us

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1914s">[31:54]</a> really a patient's digital twin and help us to understand which of the levels of aging for a

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1921s">[32:01]</a> specific patient are accelerated. Is it the molecular level, the cell level, tissue, organ system?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1928s">[32:08]</a> Is the epigenetic not really fitted for the patient, the influence of the environment? And

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1934s">[32:14]</a> at the same time, which really of the function, so the functionalities, which of the functionalities

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1940s">[32:20]</a> for the patient clinically is decreasing? Is it the vital capacity? Is it really the only

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1945s">[32:25]</a> oligofactory system? Which of the system and the organs and functions altogether are decreasing

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1951s">[32:31]</a> for a patient specifically? This allows not only to know, but also to optimize the longevity

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1959s">[32:39]</a> diagnostic and monitoring protocol. And as you can see here, it has to be granular and has to be

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1965s">[32:45]</a> individualized. And some things extend from something that has to be done daily continuously

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1972s">[32:52]</a> and to points that can be done once in a lifetime, such as whole genome sequencing, and then just to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1978s">[32:58]</a> recheck for new mutations as our knowledge of genes is growing. But at the same time,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1985s">[33:05]</a> this type of protocol is not only about do those tests, take those pills. It's a whole package of

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1993s">[33:13]</a> a longevity protocol, which also is very important. The education of the patient

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=1998s">[33:18]</a> is a longevity program ready to strategically tell the patient not only sleep well, eat well, move,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2005s">[33:25]</a> but to strategically say, you have to do this exercise so and so many times for so and so many

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2011s">[33:31]</a> minutes with this and this rate, with this and this time to rest to achieve this and that specific

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2018s">[33:38]</a> outcome for your caliper or your group strength or whatsoever this is. So really going very granular

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2025s">[33:45]</a> and individual for the patient's specific needs. Of course, we have a great help now with the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2032s">[33:52]</a> biological aging clocks and we have a whole variety of those and they are expanding and then it's just

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2037s">[33:57]</a> so wonderful to see. By far, what I'm showing here is not everything that we have. And this is just an

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2044s">[34:04]</a> example of the deep aging clocks, but very valuable to see that the variety that is out there

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2051s">[34:11]</a> and all the different people who are developing those, there is a very collaborative spirit

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2056s">[34:16]</a> because we will need to know which clock is actually measuring what. Besides of the fact to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2062s">[34:22]</a> know that, oh, this is my biological age, every doctor and hopefully also the patient will

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2067s">[34:27]</a> understand what this actually means for me. Why is my epigenetic clock showing me minus 20 years,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2071s">[34:31]</a> but my blood clock is showing me plus five? Where's the problem? How does it differ? How

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2076s">[34:36]</a> do they measure those values? I think it's very important to understand, okay, this algorithm is

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2082s">[34:42]</a> behind and epigenetic clocks are measuring your age, but they are oscillating around an axis

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2090s">[34:50]</a> and the blood clock, for example, is really based on those 45s and blood markers and it is

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2098s">[34:58]</a> predictive for mortality, but hey, maybe morbidity is different and other factors were not included.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2105s">[35:05]</a> And then at some point in time, once hopefully we will have a much thicker data set that will

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2110s">[35:10]</a> be also shared between each other, we will be able to understand what are the inter-functions

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2116s">[35:16]</a> and intersections and influences between each other between those biological aging clocks.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2121s">[35:21]</a> On top of that, it will be very important to have specific organ clocks and organ

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2127s">[35:27]</a> clocks that are working on data sets that are maybe not mainstream. So clocks based on

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2132s">[35:32]</a> epidemics, clocks based only on specific function of the heart, but on the structure,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2138s">[35:38]</a> not only on the functionality like HRV. Those are the things that are all in a pipeline,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2143s">[35:43]</a> not validated, but ongoing. And I think that it's very important for us in the clinic to embrace them

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2150s">[35:50]</a> in order really to validate. And what is also extremely important and growing, I think,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2156s">[35:56]</a> is the focus on a microbiome. So I just wanted to mention that there are already

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2163s">[36:03]</a> efforts to, and there are already clocks out there that are based on microbiome and there

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2168s">[36:08]</a> are efforts to extend those and the new, which is I think extremely important, microbiome plays

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2174s">[36:14]</a> a tremendously important role, but also clocks that are very much focusing on reproductive health

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2182s">[36:22]</a> in the productive age and then later menopause, and repulse, especially, I see Aaron is here

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2189s">[36:29]</a> and very focused on menopause and extremely focused on under pulse. And I think once we know more,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2195s">[36:35]</a> once we really understand longitudinally which hormones are changing, how can we actually measure

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2200s">[36:40]</a> the reproductive biological age or have a menopause at clock, we can do a lot more than just HRT,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2207s">[36:47]</a> hormone replacement therapy. And then as I mentioned also before, how can we really see

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2213s">[36:53]</a> the interactions and the proportions and interchanges of those different clocks

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2222s">[37:02]</a> between each other? That's very important. And how it usually looks like, for example,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2227s">[37:07]</a> for the blood age like this, most of you probably have seen it, maybe some not,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2232s">[37:12]</a> we usually after fueling in the algorithm, we get an output report and such a report is

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2239s">[37:19]</a> giving us a chronological age and then the biological age. So this was actually a patient

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2244s">[37:24]</a> young male, 41, biologically 45, without really many of the factors that were extremely out of

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2252s">[37:32]</a> the norm. So in a normative setting, we'll say, okay, your cholesterol is a bit elevated, 200 is

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2258s">[37:38]</a> norm, or anything below is good, your is 205, whatever. But as you can see here, it's really

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2263s">[37:43]</a> about the optimal values. So the norm values are being left out in that sense and the optimal

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2272s">[37:52]</a> values for that specific patient at this specific point of time is being listed. And those that are

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2277s">[37:57]</a> influenceable can be then modified with the help of doctor to reduce or increase those. And what

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2285s">[38:05]</a> was very useful is the fact that we can repeat those tests, not every week, not every month,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2292s">[38:12]</a> but it's reasonable to repeat them like every three months. If you want to really intervene

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2296s">[38:16]</a> and have somebody have a change and do something, we have the longitudinal follow up. And this was

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2303s">[38:23]</a> a patient who was actually in August, 38 biologically, and then it increased to 44,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2310s">[38:30]</a> literally within half a year. And what happened here, the patient started to actually take quite

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2315s">[38:35]</a> a bit of supplements. Oh, we might mention which ones, but let's say the dose was triple as high

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2320s">[38:40]</a> as what would usually be recommended on the supplements, thinking that more is better,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2325s">[38:45]</a> but actually very often in medicine we say less is more. So this patient's injury listens,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2331s">[38:51]</a> he didn't want to stop the supplements, he continued. And after we measured like another

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2335s">[38:55]</a> half a year later, he went up and then he started to listen and to reduce and two things

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2340s">[39:00]</a> to stop. And then the biological age actually went down. That was very good. But it's really

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2346s">[39:06]</a> a work one-on-one with the patient and it is scalable as we can see already with the public

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2353s">[39:13]</a> departments. It's scalable. It's of course less general, but it's scalable. And it's all about

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2360s">[39:20]</a> guide the right guidance where the continuous monitoring is very helpful, more detailed

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2367s">[39:27]</a> diagnostic on a larger scale and really also finding the right medication and or supplements

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2372s">[39:32]</a> for the patient in specific intervals. Now, therefore we can follow up.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2380s">[39:40]</a> I know that we have about 13 minutes left. Oh, okay. Thank you for that. We were chatting in

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2387s">[39:47]</a> upfront to make sure that I'm not going over time, which I'm apologizing for. I usually I do.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2392s">[39:52]</a> So we can really longitudinal follow up the patient and see biologically where the patient

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2397s">[39:57]</a> is standing. And there are also a few special cases for those who are interested. Sometimes we see

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2403s">[40:03]</a> a patient, this is just an example of a patient who was chronologically 29th, a female had a

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2409s">[40:09]</a> problem to get pregnant for no really apparent reasons. Hormones were okay. Everything was fine.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2415s">[40:15]</a> Structurally, gynecologically everything was fine. No children. So when we measure the biological

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2420s">[40:20]</a> age, I just said, you know, out of let's just do it. Let's see what's going on. And she went

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2424s">[40:24]</a> biologically 31. You might say the Delta is not very big, but actually for a patient at this age

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2429s">[40:29]</a> for that specific algorithm, it's a lot. And we know that patients who are being getting a Delta

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2437s">[40:37]</a> that is higher very often and they do not have apparent blood parameters that make them older.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2444s">[40:44]</a> So everything is within the norm, very often have autoimmune diseases. And indeed for that

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2449s">[40:49]</a> patient was the case actually, it was more of a beginner. So clearly she was, you know, she had

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2454s">[40:54]</a> great difficulty to get a child. So again, see things can be detected more than just, you know,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2461s">[41:01]</a> saying this is suboptimal and you can improve. And maybe just for the closure, things that are

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2469s">[41:09]</a> really passionate, that they're very passionate about. And I think that this will re-advance the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2475s">[41:15]</a> field is AI based drug discovery without making promotion for Ensilico, but they are the leaders

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2481s">[41:21]</a> you might have seen the nature biotech paper that just came out two weeks ago about the first

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2486s">[41:26]</a> drug that was AI discovered and is now in phase 2B within like less under 18 months, which usually

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2494s">[41:34]</a> takes years and billions. Anyways, so this AI based drugs are very interesting because, because

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2501s">[41:41]</a> they are using so much data power, they can actually not only focus on the disease,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2508s">[41:48]</a> but they also can integrate another function. So they have like a dual target. They can target

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2515s">[41:55]</a> a specific disease, a gene or, you know, some kindness, some enzyme, but on top of that,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2520s">[42:00]</a> do something else. So for example, the drug that was mentioned there is a drug pro-fibrosis

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2526s">[42:06]</a> developed for IPA, you know, idiopathic pulmonic fibrosis, very deadly, a horrible disease where

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2532s">[42:12]</a> there is no cure. We can only manage it and put it into a chronic state. This drug is actually

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2539s">[42:19]</a> reversing, but it's also reversing fibrosis, which is one of the main side effects of aging.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2545s">[42:25]</a> So that is very interesting. And again, it's extremely scalable because what is happening is

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2549s">[42:29]</a> huge AI robotic labs, which have zero people in it, only the robot, they can be miniaturized

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2557s">[42:37]</a> and placed in the hospitals. So me as a doctor, if I have my patients, I also work as an oncologist.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2563s">[42:43]</a> So if I have my patient and they can take a tissue and I can just send it to the robot,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2567s">[42:47]</a> that will do the high output analysis and fuel it into a database that is connected all over the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2573s">[42:53]</a> world. With my patients, I might find number one, old targets and find the right medicine for my

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2579s">[42:59]</a> patient, which is a very easy thing right now to do. But secondly, maybe I can find a new target

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2585s">[43:05]</a> and somebody else had this target as well and we can potentially create a new drug that can we use.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2593s">[43:13]</a> So again, how can we bridge the sick care and the new wave of healthy longevity medicine

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2601s">[43:21]</a> by actually doing? As I mentioned before, we already had a healthy longevity department in

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2607s">[43:27]</a> several hospitals, but at the same time, there are also hospitals that are 100% sick care hospitals

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2614s">[43:34]</a> and it's the one that they're working, for example, in China that is transforming on a little bit of

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2619s">[43:39]</a> a different level because the amount of people is much higher. And what we are doing there is

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2626s">[43:46]</a> basically building a sort of smart hospital because integration of data in that specific setting

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2633s">[43:53]</a> is the most important across the globe. With this, I'm going to finish up thanking you for your

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2641s">[44:01]</a> attention and very open for any questions and discussion. Thank you so much. You cover a really

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2650s">[44:10]</a> wide range there. That's really helpful and congrats on all of these efforts. I don't know

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2654s">[44:14]</a> how you possibly could have time for all of this. Thank you. Okay, we have Karl here with his first

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2661s">[44:21]</a> question. I was waiting for quite some time and if you want to drop your questions in the chat,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2665s">[44:25]</a> you're welcome to do so or feel free to raise your hand at this point as well.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2669s">[44:29]</a> Very expansive, impressive effort. Obviously, the world needs better education of all the positions

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2676s">[44:36]</a> on things that are going on in the field that we know and love. So my question is about

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2681s">[44:41]</a> standard of care. You talked a lot about expansion and diagnostics and stuff, but

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2688s">[44:48]</a> Nala, and I've heard lots of stuff about the whole effort from you and from Andrea, but I hardly ever

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2694s">[44:54]</a> hear anything about what the actual advice and standard of care being advocated is. What are we

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2703s">[45:03]</a> teaching? Who's deciding on what standard of care for longevity medicine is? And I think

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2711s">[45:11]</a> that's one of the things that we've been talking about for a long time is we want it to be more

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2717s">[45:17]</a> than what normal doctors are trained on. And there are some consensus from the aging research field,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2724s">[45:24]</a> but there's also a lot of controversies and things that we don't know. And yet, individual

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2728s">[45:28]</a> doctors are making their own recommendations in some of these areas. So how is the society deciding

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2735s">[45:35]</a> and advocate as standard of care in this area? Is there a plan for, especially for the controversial

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2741s">[45:41]</a> things where researchers disagree? And is there a plan for some kind of broader global conversation

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2747s">[45:47]</a> to decide on what it should be in the areas as we get more data? Or is that something that you

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2753s">[45:53]</a> and the other leaders of the movement see as more appropriate to happen behind closed doors?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2759s">[45:59]</a> I hear you. And answer to your last question for sure, no. And I also don't think a society

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2766s">[46:06]</a> can or is in place to decide anything. At this very moment, I think the society can only facilitate

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2773s">[46:13]</a> the effort to bring whatever is out there proposed as potential standard of care to higher councils

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2781s">[46:21]</a> and discuss with them what potentially can be done. But since this will take a long time,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2787s">[46:27]</a> therefore, many of you might have heard and we also among our members and broadly we said we want

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2794s">[46:34]</a> to create the working group about the guidelines, but it's not something that will happen immediately

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2799s">[46:39]</a> and nobody in my personal opinion here is in a position to say this is the standard of care.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2805s">[46:45]</a> One can recommend and this is why I mentioned at the beginning that guidelines have to start

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2811s">[46:51]</a> with guidelines, how to build guidelines in this field. And this can be only done with

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2817s">[46:57]</a> test scores with close collaboration with the councils that have been done doing this for other

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2823s">[47:03]</a> disciplines for decades. And then only after that can recommendations come as recommendations,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2830s">[47:10]</a> the lowest level of evidence and from that guidance. For me, that will take years. Therefore,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2836s">[47:16]</a> I think and definitely nothing should be happening in any field in my opinion behind closed doors.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2842s">[47:22]</a> But on top of that, I think we also need to do things already on maximum credible level.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2850s">[47:30]</a> The public setting, for example, here, of course, we understand that using some of the biological

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2855s">[47:35]</a> aging clocks might not be in the standard evidence base, but we will. So that's why we do it as a

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2861s">[47:41]</a> study, right? Every patient who is coming to the center is also a part of a study. And I guess

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2868s">[47:48]</a> that's very important and we'll be showing what later will be the recommendations in the guidelines.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2875s">[47:55]</a> Thanks.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2876s">[47:56]</a> Oh, we have Larry.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2879s">[47:59]</a> Yeah, hi. I think it was a great presentation. And I think for patients who can

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2884s">[48:04]</a> undergo the type of individualized therapy you're recommending, it could be beneficial.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2890s">[48:10]</a> The problem is, that was touched on just recently, is coordination of clinical trials,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2898s">[48:18]</a> coordination of clinical information. That was the huge problem with COVID is that there are all

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2903s">[48:23]</a> kinds of clinical trials started, but no information came out of them. And I think in longevity,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2908s">[48:28]</a> that's a little bit where they're at now. There's a lot of things going on. There isn't

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2913s">[48:33]</a> much coordination of effort. I heard Ray Curzell was on a podcast. He's taking 80 pills. I don't

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2921s">[48:41]</a> know, maybe some of them are helping him, maybe some aren't, but there's a lot of this stuff

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2924s">[48:44]</a> going forward already without very little evidence behind it. Vitamin D, there's some evidence that

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2931s">[48:51]</a> prevents cancer. There's also evidence that it might cause heart problems. A lot of these things

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2937s">[48:57]</a> to really get the real answer for which people they'll be beneficial for, it's a bit complicated,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2944s">[49:04]</a> but if you don't coordinate studies, we're just going to be at the same place we are 10 years from

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2950s">[49:10]</a> now when people are taking all kinds of things and nobody knows what really works. And there's all

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2955s">[49:15]</a> kinds of biomarkers out there and some are contradictory to each other as well. And I think

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2961s">[49:21]</a> the important thing are simple studies that improve people's lives. And I don't know if you

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2966s">[49:26]</a> need the depth of study that you're doing for that. So first of all, thanks for mentioning many

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2972s">[49:32]</a> aspects. And I guess, again, I can speak for me personally, but I know that many people share it

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2977s">[49:37]</a> and I'm actually going to quote Dr. Cran here, coordination and collaboration, I think, is

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2982s">[49:42]</a> tremendously important. Most of the clinical trials that are running in oncology, for example,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2987s">[49:47]</a> are not exactly coordinated in a way that everybody will need to report to everybody

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2992s">[49:52]</a> how to do it. There are no massive consortia, but there is a coordination because people

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=2997s">[49:57]</a> talk to each other much more than we can because it's already an established discipline and there's

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=3002s">[50:02]</a> a little bit of a different exchange and there are guidelines that cannot be crossed paths.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=3006s">[50:06]</a> We are starting something new. I like to compare this to interventional radiology,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=3011s">[50:11]</a> discipline that became very successful in a very short period of time. But if you look up for

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=3016s">[50:16]</a> guidelines in interventional radiology, you will not find much, right? But still it's working,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=3020s">[50:20]</a> it's working very well. So I think coordination is important, but without over regulation.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=3028s">[50:28]</a> And at the same time, I think it's also important to exchange data more. So rather than just

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=3036s">[50:36]</a> coordinate, also exchange. And yes, of course, there are plenty of potential biomarkers out

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=3042s">[50:42]</a> there that have been published already since the last decade. I think the consortia that are out

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=3047s">[50:47]</a> there, which I'm a big fan of, is their role in the way to at least give us a way to validate that,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=3055s">[50:55]</a> even within clinical trials. But one thing I didn't have time to talk about and which I think is a

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=3060s">[51:00]</a> very important key point in longevity medicine, and hopefully it will be done much more, is the N

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=3067s">[51:07]</a> equals one clinical trial, which is not the same as trying out and anecdotal, but really N1

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=3075s">[51:15]</a> clinical trial in the setting. I think we will learn a lot from this as well.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=3081s">[51:21]</a> Lila So Wonderful. We unfortunately only have one minute left. And so I always wanted to finish on

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W72MjVP6DlE&t=3087s">[51:27]</a> the note of if people are excited about your work and with what you work, many different efforts,

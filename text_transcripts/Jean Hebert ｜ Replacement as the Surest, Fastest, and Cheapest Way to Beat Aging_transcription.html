  <pre class="transcript"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=0s">[00:00]</a> Hi, Ron, welcome to Farsight's Biotech and Health Extension Group,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=3s">[00:03]</a> sponsored by 100 Plus Capital.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=5s">[00:05]</a> I'm really excited to have Jean-Auber back with us again.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=8s">[00:08]</a> I think it's maybe your third appearance here in one of the seminars.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=11s">[00:11]</a> And we've definitely had the luck to have you on for a lot of other workshops.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=15s">[00:15]</a> I think we got in touch for the first time a few years ago when you wrote

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=18s">[00:18]</a> a really amazing book on the replacing paradigm to aging.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=22s">[00:22]</a> And yeah, you've since done a lot of research and now also have a really

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=26s">[00:26]</a> wonderful company underway.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=27s">[00:27]</a> And so we thought that it would be really fun to invite you back, given that

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=30s">[00:30]</a> replacing as now really mentioned, I think in the Amaranth Foundation and their

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=35s">[00:35]</a> longevity bottleneck assessment in the longevity biotech fellowship roadmap.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=39s">[00:39]</a> And so I think it's just popping up a lot as a theme that is pretty undervalued

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=43s">[00:43]</a> within longevity, but like really promising.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=45s">[00:45]</a> And so I'm really excited to have you here as to me, the pioneer who really

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=49s">[00:49]</a> like first set the whole entire kind of like sub-domain within aging on the map,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=53s">[00:53]</a> at least for me.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=55s">[00:55]</a> So thanks a lot for joining, John.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=56s">[00:56]</a> And you'll be discussing replacement as the surest, fastest and cheapest way to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=59s">[00:59]</a> building aging.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=60s">[01:00]</a> And I will share a lot more about your bio in the chat, but without further

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=64s">[01:04]</a> ado, thanks a lot for joining and the stage is yours.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=67s">[01:07]</a> Thanks so much, Alison, for having me again.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=70s">[01:10]</a> I hope you can hear me well enough.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=74s">[01:14]</a> Yeah, no, it's a pleasure to be back.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=76s">[01:16]</a> And it's nice to see that replacement is growing in appreciation in the field.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=84s">[01:24]</a> I think it's really because it deserves more attention and hope, maybe I'll

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=89s">[01:29]</a> convince you of that today.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=91s">[01:31]</a> The title is a bit provocative, but I think it's totally defensible.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=97s">[01:37]</a> I am happy to discuss this.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=99s">[01:39]</a> I'll show a few slides and open to this being interactive and stimulating

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=106s">[01:46]</a> discussion about this.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=107s">[01:47]</a> I'm going to be telling you about replacement and why I think it's the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=112s">[01:52]</a> surest and fastest and also cheapest way of building aging.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=118s">[01:58]</a> So first of all, why even consider a replacement as an approach to life

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=123s">[02:03]</a> extension?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=124s">[02:04]</a> Let's start with an example.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=127s">[02:07]</a> I got this from Anar Isnan who posted this recently, but I think it's a pretty

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=132s">[02:12]</a> illustrative picture.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=133s">[02:13]</a> This is the same person decades apart.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=136s">[02:16]</a> Some of you may recognize this person, Clint Eastwood, well-known actor and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=142s">[02:22]</a> director, but this is what aging does.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=145s">[02:25]</a> And what exactly is the difference that we're looking at here between the same

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=151s">[02:31]</a> person decades apart?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=153s">[02:33]</a> And really what it is, is this accumulation of damage that occurs.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=159s">[02:39]</a> It's stochastic.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=161s">[02:41]</a> It's complex damage.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=163s">[02:43]</a> I've listed some of the forms of damage that are accumulated to protein over

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=167s">[02:47]</a> time here, especially to long-lived percains.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=170s">[02:50]</a> These are just classes of damage.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=172s">[02:52]</a> So they each break down into different specific types of damage to the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=178s">[02:58]</a> percains.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=179s">[02:59]</a> So it's very complex.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=180s">[03:00]</a> It happens somewhat randomly.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=182s">[03:02]</a> This is not programmed.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=185s">[03:05]</a> And most importantly, it's non-enzymatic, meaning it's not a biological process.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=191s">[03:11]</a> It's really a physical process of the breakdown of long-lived proteins over

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=198s">[03:18]</a> time.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=199s">[03:19]</a> And this is particularly important because approaches like drugs that are

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=206s">[03:26]</a> targeting biological pathways, aren't going to have much of an impact on the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=213s">[03:33]</a> physical process.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=215s">[03:35]</a> Also, we pretty much know all the genes in the genome now, and we can say with

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=221s">[03:41]</a> confidence that there are no genes encoded in our genome that recognize this

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=227s">[03:47]</a> damage or that encode the machinery that can deal with this damage.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=232s">[03:52]</a> So genetic approaches and epigenetic approaches are not really going to have

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=237s">[03:57]</a> much of an impact.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=239s">[03:59]</a> You might say, oh, there are, you know, for these extra cell or long-lived

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=243s">[04:03]</a> proteins that accumulate this damage, there are things like collagenase.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=248s">[04:08]</a> It's known that collagenases stop working on these percains when they

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=254s">[04:14]</a> accumulate damage.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=255s">[04:15]</a> So we're really left with nothing in the cell that can deal with this.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=261s">[04:21]</a> And we know that this damage that accumulates around and outside of cells

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=269s">[04:29]</a> really has a big impact on the behavior of these cells in terms of whether

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=273s">[04:33]</a> they're behaving like young cells or old cells.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=276s">[04:36]</a> So these are called heterochronic transplants, where you can take cells

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=280s">[04:40]</a> from a young tissue and then transplant them in an old tissue or vice versa.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=286s">[04:46]</a> And what matters is that the cells are not going to be affected by the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=290s">[04:50]</a> damage, but what matters is, you know, the end tissue that the cells end up in.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=295s">[04:55]</a> So young cells in an old tissue behave like old cells, old cells in a young

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=301s">[05:01]</a> tissue behave like young cells.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=303s">[05:03]</a> You know, we can kill ourselves trying to make these cells young again, which

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=307s">[05:07]</a> I would argue most of the longevity field is still focused on.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=311s">[05:11]</a> And that's really not going to have much of an impact unless we deal with all

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=316s">[05:16]</a> the extra cellular components as well.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=319s">[05:19]</a> The only way to do that at this point, or at least the most direct way is to do

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=327s">[05:27]</a> tissue level or greater replacements, you know, organ level, tissue level,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=331s">[05:31]</a> whole replacements.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=335s">[05:35]</a> You know, replacements are already used in the clinic.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=339s">[05:39]</a> So there's not too much of a hurdle there.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=341s">[05:41]</a> They're used to reverse damage caused by trauma, for example, or to cure

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=347s">[05:47]</a> certain diseases.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=349s">[05:49]</a> But of course, they could be used for a lot more if we're thinking about life

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=354s">[05:54]</a> extension. And so I'll go over, you know, the different types of replacement

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=359s">[05:59]</a> approaches, both for the body and the brain and the pros and cons.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=363s">[06:03]</a> And, you know, then this could potentially stimulate discussions about, you know,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=371s">[06:11]</a> some of the I probably missed some of the pros and cons or definitely open

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=376s">[06:16]</a> to feedback on that.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=378s">[06:18]</a> But first, I just wanted to make a sort of a side by side comparison again with

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=382s">[06:22]</a> much of the focus of the longevity field versus replacement.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=387s">[06:27]</a> And so what are the advantages of taking a replacement approach?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=391s">[06:31]</a> You know, a lot of us have heard that, oh, we have to understand aging before we

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=396s">[06:36]</a> can address it. Maybe, but not if you're using replacement where you do, you

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=401s">[06:41]</a> know, wholesale tissue replacement, all the damage is reversed at once and you

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=406s">[06:46]</a> don't really have to understand, you know, that thousands of things that are going

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=410s">[06:50]</a> wrong with aging to be able to reverse that aging biomarkers.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=415s">[06:55]</a> A similar idea. You know, you can find limitless, limitless numbers of things

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=421s">[07:01]</a> that change with aging and call them biomarkers and say, you know, they're more

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=425s">[07:05]</a> or less important.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=427s">[07:07]</a> But again, you don't really need that when you're doing tissue or greater level

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=431s">[07:11]</a> replacements. Another aspect of the focus of the longevity field is to really get

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=438s">[07:18]</a> the FDA to approve drugs as anti-aging drugs to get them on board with

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=444s">[07:24]</a> longevity research.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=446s">[07:26]</a> And, you know, that's great.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=448s">[07:28]</a> The more people we get on board with longevity research, the more we get

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=452s">[07:32]</a> government regulatory entities on board with the idea of life extension, the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=458s">[07:38]</a> better. But for replacement, we don't actually need that.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=462s">[07:42]</a> Replacements are generally approved.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=465s">[07:45]</a> We've seen recently in the news, for example, a woman just got, you know, two

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=471s">[07:51]</a> pig organs transplanted at the same time, you know, kidney and thymus.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=476s">[07:56]</a> And previously, other individuals have gotten also a xeno, xeno transplants for

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=482s">[08:02]</a> other organs.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=484s">[08:04]</a> And of course, tissue engineered organs have been used in the clinic.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=488s">[08:08]</a> And of course, a lot of donor to recipient organ transplants were in every body

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=495s">[08:15]</a> part has been transplanted that way in people.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=499s">[08:19]</a> So the FDA is very much on board with these replacement strategies already, even

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=505s">[08:25]</a> though right now they're for disease and trauma.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=509s">[08:29]</a> But in general, there's no restrictions there.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=513s">[08:33]</a> Also, you know, getting more scientists interested.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=516s">[08:36]</a> Again, that's very important.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=517s">[08:37]</a> Nothing wrong with that.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=519s">[08:39]</a> But in terms of replacement and this regenerative medicine approach, there's a

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=524s">[08:44]</a> ton of talent out there.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=526s">[08:46]</a> It's one of the hottest areas of research in biology.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=529s">[08:49]</a> And it's right now there are certainly sufficient talent there.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=534s">[08:54]</a> It's just a matter of funding to hire them.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=538s">[08:58]</a> The costs of, you know, going about, you know, extending lifespan by targeting all

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=545s">[09:05]</a> the different pathways involved and trying to modify them are indefinite at this point.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=552s">[09:12]</a> This is largely based on work done by the LBF, the recent LBF roadmap, where they

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=560s">[09:20]</a> went out and talked to a lot of people about, you know, how much it would cost to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=564s">[09:24]</a> get to particular milestones and how long it would take.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=568s">[09:28]</a> And the cost is indeterminate because the timeline is indeterminate and there

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=573s">[09:33]</a> would be lots that would need to be addressed.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=577s">[09:37]</a> In the case of replacement, you know, the milestones are very well defined for the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=582s">[09:42]</a> different approaches, which we'll go over again in a minute.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=585s">[09:45]</a> And so you can come up with cost estimates for that, which are, you know,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=591s">[09:51]</a> significant rate less.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=593s">[09:53]</a> Again, thank you to Leeav, Mark Hamelainen in particular for putting that together.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=600s">[10:00]</a> Yeah.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=601s">[10:01]</a> And then of course, you know, we don't even know with all these efforts.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=604s">[10:04]</a> And I would argue that the probability of success with these efforts is very low.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=610s">[10:10]</a> Whereas with replacement, we know if we succeed in doing it, that, you know, if

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=615s">[10:15]</a> you have an old body and replace it with a young body, you will have reversed aging.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=621s">[10:21]</a> It's very high probability of success.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=624s">[10:24]</a> Okay.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=625s">[10:25]</a> So I don't know if there's any questions yet at this point.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=630s">[10:30]</a> No, you're good.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=631s">[10:31]</a> Good.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=632s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=632s">[10:32]</a></a> All right.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=632s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=632s">[10:32]</a></a> So let's start with replacement for the body.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=637s">[10:37]</a> And there are several possible options of how we can go about it.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=642s">[10:42]</a> In this case, there's biological, two broad categories, biological, non-biological.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=648s">[10:48]</a> And then within the biological, you can do full body replacement.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=652s">[10:52]</a> You can do all internal organs at once, or you can do more, you know, part by

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=658s">[10:58]</a> part, organ by organ replacement as well.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=661s">[11:01]</a> So those are different approaches and we'll touch upon each of those.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=666s">[11:06]</a> Then a non-biological, similarly, you could do potentially, you know, full body

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=672s">[11:12]</a> or all organs more part by part as well.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=676s">[11:16]</a> And, you know, there's efforts going on for all these approaches and, you know,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=682s">[11:22]</a> initial early proofs of concept that it can be done.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=687s">[11:27]</a> So whole body replacement, you know, it's conceptually the most straightforward.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=693s">[11:33]</a> I think it's also technically the most straightforward because it really

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=696s">[11:36]</a> doesn't involve any new tech, or it doesn't exist, the tech has to be adapted to this.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=704s">[11:44]</a> But again, you know, the proof of concepts are there that the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=707s">[11:47]</a> technology could work for this.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=709s">[11:49]</a> But it would involve taking these primitive cells, germ cells, or other

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=714s">[11:54]</a> primitive stem cells, and just growing brainless bodies.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=719s">[11:59]</a> Obviously we don't, wouldn't want, you know, this to be unethical in any way.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=724s">[12:04]</a> And so if there is no brain there and it's just a body, it should be okay to use.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=730s">[12:10]</a> And then, you know, he would use that to replace an old person's body with the young

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=735s">[12:15]</a> bind. So basically you would do a body transplant.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=740s">[12:20]</a> So the head, the old head would be on a young bind.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=744s">[12:24]</a> The pros for this are everything except the brain is young at once.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=750s">[12:30]</a> You know, in one shot, there's potential for immune matching, depending on where

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=756s">[12:36]</a> these cells come from that you're using to make the body.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=760s">[12:40]</a> And as I mentioned, it requires a little new tech, you know, proof of concept in

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=765s">[12:45]</a> preclinical models has been done for all these steps.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=770s">[12:50]</a> The downsides are, you know, the social resistance.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=774s">[12:54]</a> People will hear this and go, oh my God, this is crazy.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=778s">[12:58]</a> And so I think that's a hurdle that needs to be addressed.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=785s">[13:05]</a> And you also need to deal with the severed spinal cord when you do a head or brain

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=790s">[13:10]</a> transplant, although there to the technology is advanced or quite a bit to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=795s">[13:15]</a> either bypass the spinal cord severing, for example, using brain machine

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=801s">[13:21]</a> interfaces, which are in clinical trials or biologically regrowing those

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=806s">[13:26]</a> connections where a lot of progress has been made as well.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=809s">[13:29]</a> Our room cannot claim success on that yet.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=813s">[13:33]</a> And also scaling is our consideration here that is not necessarily the easiest to address.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=821s">[13:41]</a> So another approach that is being considered and explored is simply

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=827s">[13:47]</a> replacing all internal organs at once.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=831s">[13:51]</a> It's actually not that complicated a surgery because there are not too many

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=836s">[13:56]</a> tubes at the top and the bottom of all these organs.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=840s">[14:00]</a> So the surgery would appear to be doable, although that has not been tested yet.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=846s">[14:06]</a> And, but it is an approach.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=848s">[14:08]</a> The advantages in this case, instead of doing like the whole body transplant is

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=853s">[14:13]</a> that there's no spinal cord severing and there's still possibility for immune

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=858s">[14:18]</a> matching and also requires little new tech.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=862s">[14:22]</a> But here too, you know, the social acceptance of such an approach might

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=868s">[14:28]</a> require, you know, a fair amount of, you know, convincing that this is great to be

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=874s">[14:34]</a> saving lives and, and, and no one's getting hurt.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=877s">[14:37]</a> And, you know, that this is really the right thing to do.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=881s">[14:41]</a> But that is definitely, I think, something that would still need to be addressed.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=885s">[14:45]</a> In this case, not all body parts are replaced.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=889s">[14:49]</a> It's just the internal organs, which you could argue would likely have benefits on health.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=896s">[14:56]</a> But, you know, and I put this in the cons because it's not all body parts.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=900s">[15:00]</a> And I would worry though, because, you know, even like the limbs, for example, that are

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=906s">[15:06]</a> aging over time, put you at risk of death as their blood vessels, you know, get old,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=913s">[15:13]</a> you're more likely to get clots, which can result in pulmonary embolisms and kill you,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=919s">[15:19]</a> for example.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=920s">[15:20]</a> You know, maybe it would extend a maximal lifespan, which would be great.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=924s">[15:24]</a> You know, not necessarily.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=925s">[15:25]</a> You still have to consider those other body parts.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=928s">[15:28]</a> Scaling again here too, is not something that is obvious, although, you know, there are

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=935s">[15:35]</a> solutions.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=936s">[15:36]</a> So the other approach is to do more organ by organ or part by part.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=941s">[15:41]</a> And we've seen a lot of evidence of this in a clinic already, as I mentioned, you know,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=947s">[15:47]</a> recently, you know, transplants where you basically use normal developmental processes

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=955s">[15:55]</a> to generate organs of the right size, which is why pinks are used.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=960s">[16:00]</a> And then if you can deal with the immune incompatibility, then you can use this for

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=967s">[16:07]</a> transplantation.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=968s">[16:08]</a> So that's an approach that's getting a lot of attention now and is being used in certain

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=974s">[16:14]</a> cases in clinical trials.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=977s">[16:17]</a> With, you know, certain amount of success, those organs are working in humans, but, you

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=984s">[16:24]</a> know, still ways to go there in terms of reducing the immune rejection risk among other things.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=992s">[16:32]</a> And in this particular case with xenotransplantation, one of the downsides is, you know,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=996s">[16:36]</a> you're still using animals for this.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=999s">[16:39]</a> Although, again, there, there may be a way around it because, you know, in preclinical

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1006s">[16:46]</a> studies, we do know how to make non-sentient bodies.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1010s">[16:50]</a> And so that could be a way of resolving that issue.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1014s">[16:54]</a> In any case, there's also other approaches like blastocyst complementation.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1019s">[16:59]</a> So in this case, you would be growing human organs in another species like the pig, again,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1025s">[17:05]</a> for size compatibility.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1027s">[17:07]</a> But in this case, the organs would be made of human cells.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1032s">[17:12]</a> And then, of course, there's what, you know, the field has been working on for quite some

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1037s">[17:17]</a> time with fairly slow progress is tissue engineering.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1042s">[17:22]</a> And that's where you basically make de novo organs in the lab that can be used for

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1048s">[17:28]</a> transplantation.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1050s">[17:30]</a> And there's been some success, you know, like the bladder that's already probably a couple

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1055s">[17:35]</a> of decades ago or at least a decade and a half.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1058s">[17:38]</a> And, you know, those are functioning in humans quite well.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1062s">[17:42]</a> And so that's a success.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1064s">[17:44]</a> But those have been far and few in between.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1067s">[17:47]</a> And I think the advantage of these other approaches like the xenotransplantation or growing

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1074s">[17:54]</a> in human organs in the pig, for example, is that they don't require really other than

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1082s">[18:02]</a> genetic engineering for the immune compatibility.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1084s">[18:04]</a> They don't require tissue engineering because it's really letting nature or the developmental

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1091s">[18:11]</a> process occur on its own as it normally does.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1096s">[18:16]</a> And I think that's a concept that is really going to take over her replacement field over

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1103s">[18:23]</a> time is just using normal developmental processes to generate the tissues, the organs, the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1111s">[18:31]</a> organs that we want for replacement.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1114s">[18:34]</a> Because we don't, again, have to understand all the steps or, you know, we don't have to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1119s">[18:39]</a> be able to de novo make things from scratch.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1123s">[18:43]</a> They will just grow and develop naturally as they normally would, you know, when we were

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1127s">[18:47]</a> a piece is growing up and becoming kids and growing up into adults.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1133s">[18:53]</a> Yeah.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1134s">[18:54]</a> In this case, the advantages, again, no spinal cord severing scaling could be easier.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1140s">[19:00]</a> Again, depends on which of these approaches you're taking.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1145s">[19:05]</a> And in all cases, it's already happening.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1148s">[19:08]</a> So, there's early proof of concept that this can work.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1152s">[19:12]</a> The downsides, if you're going to do it this way, it means a lot of surgeries, which,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1160s">[19:20]</a> you know, again, puts you at greater risk of complications.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1164s">[19:24]</a> And it's hard to replace all body parts this way, although conceivable and you could.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1170s">[19:30]</a> And the immune mismatching, again, that can be different depending on the approaches here.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1176s">[19:36]</a> But, you know, it is a challenge with these using these different parts.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1183s">[19:43]</a> All right.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1185s">[19:45]</a> So, there's also a non-biological approach to replacement where you can do replace, like,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1192s">[19:52]</a> all the organs of the body with synthetic replacements.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1196s">[19:56]</a> And, you know, I only know one lab who's doing this, but they seem to be doing quite well.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1204s">[20:04]</a> This is, you know, the BrainX from Narzostanzla, but, you know, and so they have this completely

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1213s">[20:13]</a> synthetic artificial system that replaces the need for all our organs.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1219s">[20:19]</a> And, you know, of course, because this is engineered, it could also easily be

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1223s">[20:23]</a> replaced when it gets old or the parts can be maintained much more like an old car

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1229s">[20:29]</a> where you can keep it going indefinitely if you change all the parts.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1233s">[20:33]</a> So, this is an interesting approach that, you know, I'm keeping an eye on.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1238s">[20:38]</a> We should all keep an eye on.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1239s">[20:39]</a> The advantages are easy scaling and there's opportunities here for

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1244s">[20:44]</a> brain machine interfaces to combine that with controlling limbs, for example.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1251s">[20:51]</a> I think that's an advantage.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1252s">[20:52]</a> I also put it in the disadvantages because brain machine interfaces are required in this case to,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1259s">[20:59]</a> you know, be able to interact with the outside world.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1262s">[21:02]</a> And so, the state of the art for these brain machine interfaces are getting pretty good

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1269s">[21:09]</a> for the machine reading your intentions and being able to control limbs, whether they're

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1276s">[21:16]</a> artificial or your own limbs, if you're paralyzed, for example.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1280s">[21:20]</a> So, they're getting pretty good at that, or they are pretty good at that already.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1284s">[21:24]</a> But there's very little in the way of sensory input to the brain using machine interfaces.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1293s">[21:33]</a> And so, that's an area I think where before this can be useful, that would need to be addressed.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1300s">[21:40]</a> And then, you know, potentially, you still have to worry about the unbarricaded parts

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1305s">[21:45]</a> that are biological that you haven't replaced.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1309s">[21:49]</a> But, you know, that could potentially be addressed, again, using synthetic body parts

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1316s">[21:56]</a> like synthetic limbs, for example, which become very sophisticated and perform, you know,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1322s">[22:02]</a> almost as well or maybe in some cases better than our natural limbs, certainly better than

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1329s">[22:09]</a> our natural limbs as we get old.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1332s">[22:12]</a> So, that's also an approach that I think is of interest.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1335s">[22:15]</a> And of course, there is a fully artificial heart that's being used now in people.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1342s">[22:22]</a> There's also kidney-like bioreactors that are in preclinical state, parts are working pretty well.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1350s">[22:30]</a> And other organs potentially also follow suit.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1354s">[22:34]</a> So, you can do this also, this replacement with synthetics,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1358s">[22:38]</a> either part by part or the whole thing.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1363s">[22:43]</a> And, you know, the brain remains biological, maybe other parts of the body would be biological as

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1369s">[22:49]</a> well if you were doing this in combination with biological replacements.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1374s">[22:54]</a> So, there's a bio-machine, you know, the compatibility is not always perfect.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1381s">[23:01]</a> And so, there's a risk there.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1385s">[23:05]</a> I think the technology can stand to improve a little bit.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1388s">[23:08]</a> It's gotten pretty good with blood vessels, which are really important because, you know,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1392s">[23:12]</a> if the biological vessel detaches from the synthetic one, it can be pretty disastrous.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1398s">[23:18]</a> But I think a lot of progress has been made there.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1400s">[23:20]</a> But, you know, overall, again, still some progress to be made.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1404s">[23:24]</a> So, that's the body replacement approaches.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1408s">[23:28]</a> I'm going to move to the brain, but unless anybody has questions in the meantime.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1413s">[23:33]</a> There's no question.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1414s">[23:34]</a> There's one, but I think we can move on and then we'll take them back.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1417s">[23:37]</a> One by one.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1418s">[23:38]</a> Okay.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1419s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1419s">[23:39]</a></a> Okay.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1419s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1419s">[23:39]</a></a> Great.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1421s">[23:41]</a> So, brain tissue replacement.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1423s">[23:43]</a> Obviously, we can't replace the whole brain at once.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1426s">[23:46]</a> It would be a different person.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1428s">[23:48]</a> So, we have to consider how we do this.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1430s">[23:50]</a> And the only way would be progressive tissue replacement.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1435s">[23:55]</a> And again, in the, you know, in terms of FDA approval in the clinic, this doesn't seem to be

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1442s">[24:02]</a> a problem using cells or we don't call them tissues yet, but there are combinations of,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1449s">[24:09]</a> you know, scaffolds and cells that are being used.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1452s">[24:12]</a> So, you call them very primitive tissues that are used in people already.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1456s">[24:16]</a> So, you know, there's no roadblock there in terms of getting it to the clinic.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1460s">[24:20]</a> Here are some successes in terms of treating Parkinson's and epilepsy with our new cells.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1467s">[24:27]</a> These companies like Aspen, Neuroscience, Blue Rock, Neurona.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1474s">[24:34]</a> Aspen not yet.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1475s">[24:35]</a> They have FDA approval, but everybody knows, anticipates that their cells are going to be

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1480s">[24:40]</a> as good as Blue Rock's without the need for immune suppression because they're autologous.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1487s">[24:47]</a> But these companies have shown safety in the clinic and efficacy of their cells in these brain

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1494s">[24:54]</a> transplants. And, you know, they're also commercially very viable successes.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1500s">[25:00]</a> So, the companies are worth a lot at this point.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1503s">[25:03]</a> Again, because it works, their cells work to reverse, you know, these are in the case

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1508s">[25:08]</a> of Parkinson's, atrial disease. And then, of course, in the case of epilepsy,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1513s">[25:13]</a> just their neurological disease. That's just to say that, you know, that there's a path to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1520s">[25:20]</a> getting this implemented in the clinic. But there's two reasons why progressive brain tissue

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1527s">[25:27]</a> replacement makes sense. One is that it appears that we'll be able to add new tissue to the brains

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1536s">[25:36]</a> and have it functionally integrate with the existing brain. This was shown most nicely,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1545s">[25:45]</a> you know, already eight years ago in Germany by Magda Wiener-Gurtz's lab showing that

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1550s">[25:50]</a> transplanted embryonic precursors differentiate into neurons that integrate remarkably well

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1557s">[25:57]</a> with the adult neural circuitry. So, very promising result there. And then this was repeated

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1564s">[26:04]</a> and continues to be repeated by a bunch of different labs, including ours, just showing that,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1570s">[26:10]</a> you know, you can get really good integration of new neurons in the brain. Whether you're

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1576s">[26:16]</a> transplanting the associated cells or organoids, they all seem to do quite well.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1584s">[26:24]</a> Yeah, I just have some examples here and they all basically say the same thing,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1589s">[26:29]</a> that the neurons integrate really well. However, we're not there yet in terms of those neurons

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1596s">[26:36]</a> truly being functional because there's things missing. So, these are typically a single neuronal

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1604s">[26:44]</a> type or at least a single neuronal class, a single class of neurons, for example,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1610s">[26:50]</a> excitatory neurons and not inhibitory neurons. And so, we know that without the full complement

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1617s">[26:57]</a> of neuronal subtypes, that tissue or that graft cannot process information normally.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1624s">[27:04]</a> It also lacks structure. So, we know the structure is really important for the wiring within the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1630s">[27:10]</a> tissue or in this case, within the graft. And so, the cells are all mixed up, which they are in all

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1636s">[27:16]</a> these applications, including in the work read down and published. You're not going to get

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1641s">[27:21]</a> information processing that's useful to the host. We still have work to do. But again, this is,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1649s">[27:29]</a> you know, doesn't require development of new technologies. It just requires doing things right.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1656s">[27:36]</a> But so, this shows at least in principle that we can add, should be able to add new tissue

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1662s">[27:42]</a> to the old brain and have it functionally integrate. But important to progressive tissue

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1667s">[27:47]</a> replacement is not just the addition of new tissue, but the removal of old tissue, which

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1673s">[27:53]</a> inevitably lead to strokes and other bad things. So, we need to get rid of that tissue.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1679s">[27:59]</a> And we already have a proof of concept in the clinic that oral tissue can be removed without

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1689s">[28:09]</a> loss of its information content or interruption of function or personality or self-identity

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1697s">[28:17]</a> in cases slow growing benign gliomas that occur in people of any age, but typically more so as

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1705s">[28:25]</a> you get older. So, even in patients in their 70s, for example, they get these tumors that

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1710s">[28:30]</a> grow from a pinpoint out and eat away a certain area of the brain or the neoportex in particular.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1719s">[28:39]</a> And let's say it eats away at the language center over the course of an extended period of time.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1726s">[28:46]</a> Those individuals don't lose the ability to speak because language gets re-encoded in a

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1731s">[28:51]</a> different part of the neoportex because of the progressive nature of the construction of the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1737s">[28:57]</a> tissue and because the person is using language every day. If you have a stroke in the language

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1743s">[29:03]</a> center, it's a catastrophic event. There's no time for the relocation or the plasticity to occur

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1750s">[29:10]</a> and you lose language. But these tumors show that you can, you know, lose tissue slowly over time

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1757s">[29:17]</a> without losing the information content in it, without you even realizing that it's happening.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1763s">[29:23]</a> So, this is the other half of the equation. We can add tissue and we can progressively remove

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1770s">[29:30]</a> tissue without loss of information content. So, great. You know, how might we go about doing this?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1777s">[29:37]</a> There are different here too, just like for the body, for the brain, there are different approaches.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1783s">[29:43]</a> There's an engineering approach where, again, you're in all cases inspired by the normal

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1790s">[29:50]</a> developmental process. So, you want to recapitulate that normal developmental process.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1796s">[29:56]</a> And this is something that my group is working on, engineering a fetal-like neocortical tissue,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1805s">[30:05]</a> which is very well defined after you're in, you know, extensive omics analysis to know what

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1811s">[30:11]</a> precursor cell types are present there, what are the extracellular signals and scaffolding

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1817s">[30:17]</a> components that are necessary for those cells to develop into a well-structured, mature tissue

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1825s">[30:25]</a> that can process information normally. So, we've done this analysis, we can generate all the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1831s">[30:31]</a> components. Sorry, this is a bit of a plug for the work we're doing, but it's only a couple of slides.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1839s">[30:39]</a> And so, we've actually generated a proto tissue now, you know, has the structure and the precursor

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1845s">[30:45]</a> cell types that we want, and we've started testing this in animals. Again, still a lot of work to do,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1852s">[30:52]</a> but, you know, we think it's possible to engineer this fetal-like tissue to give rise to structured,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1859s">[30:59]</a> functional adult tissue. It's not the only approach though, although it does have advantages in terms

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1866s">[31:06]</a> of surgical implementation, because since we're designing the tissue, we can design the shape

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1871s">[31:11]</a> and adjust it to each lesion site, for example, and it's much easier to scale than the approaches

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1880s">[31:20]</a> I'm going to tell you about now. The disadvantage is it's harder to get it right, because compared

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1887s">[31:27]</a> to the advantages I'm going to show you now as well, and those approaches are basically to use

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1895s">[31:35]</a> normal development to obtain the same precursor tissue, in this case not engineered, but derived

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1901s">[31:41]</a> from earlier developmental stages. So, you may have heard of these ex-utero synthetic fetuses

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1908s">[31:48]</a> that different groups are working on. So, they start with human pluripotent stem cells in culture,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1914s">[31:54]</a> which, you know, standard practice now in terms of deriving those from individuals,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1919s">[31:59]</a> and then developing them into these sort of early fetuses. And the big advantage here is that those

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1928s">[32:08]</a> tissues are more likely to be authentic. This is also scalable, which is nice. The disadvantage

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1936s">[32:16]</a> is the need potentially for synthetic uteri to get to older stages where we can actually collect

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1945s">[32:25]</a> this fetal-like tissue for our grafts instead of engineering it, for example,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1950s">[32:30]</a> and that hasn't been developed yet. Otherwise, you know, it may be hard to get these

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1958s">[32:38]</a> synthetic fetuses to develop to a stage that's old enough that we could collect tissue without

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1965s">[32:45]</a> necrosis setting in. You know, people are working on it and they're smart people and hopefully

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1971s">[32:51]</a> they'll succeed here. Another way is to use interspecies chimeras. There were two papers that

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1978s">[32:58]</a> just came out this month showing that you could grow, I think there was some rat cells in mice

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1985s">[33:05]</a> and get, in both cases, it's not complete. So, it's not clean. I think there's ways that you

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1991s">[33:11]</a> could make this a lot cleaner. But in red here is a rat brain tissue in an otherwise mouse brain.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=1999s">[33:19]</a> And in another study, they show a similar thing, although the degree of chimeras in a way is worse.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2006s">[33:26]</a> I think this could be improved and you could imagine growing human fetal tissue, brain tissue

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2016s">[33:36]</a> in another species to obtain a source for transplantation and repair.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2022s">[33:42]</a> And then you could use human fetal tissue itself. You know, this has been used for quite some time,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2029s">[33:49]</a> you know, for Parkinson's, for example, in 1987, 88, and then ever since, human fetal brain tissue

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2038s">[33:58]</a> has been used to treat Parkinson's in particular. And, you know, one could imagine but using human

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2045s">[34:05]</a> fetal tissue could be a source or tissue for transplantation. Disadvantage, you know, there is

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2051s">[34:11]</a> some social opposition to using human fetal tissue, even though at this point, you know, there are not

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2057s">[34:17]</a> even any functional neurons there. So, it's really not, you know, there's no sentience. And the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2063s">[34:23]</a> scaling is also, you know, problematic. But in any case, that's an alternative approach where we know

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2070s">[34:30]</a> the tissue is truly authentic. So, I think that's pretty much it. For the brain, this is just a

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2075s">[34:35]</a> cartoon showing how, you know, the addition and removal of all tissue could be implemented.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2082s">[34:42]</a> We have ways, although they haven't been adapted to our purposes yet, but we have ways of

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2088s">[34:48]</a> progressively silencing brain tissue from a pinpoint out that would mimic a artificial

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2096s">[34:56]</a> glioma because we wouldn't want to use the glioma to silence tissue as an example, I'm sure, of your

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2102s">[35:02]</a> earlier. But we have ways of doing that. So, you could progressively silence parts of the brain

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2108s">[35:08]</a> while putting in your fetal tissue in other areas and allowing progressive silencing and tissue

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2117s">[35:17]</a> development and integration occur coincidentally and repeating this a few times. So, that's a

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2124s">[35:24]</a> way of doing that. I went over that fast, you know, happy to go over it in more detail.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2131s">[35:31]</a> It's very interesting. But the point is, you know, none of this seems, requires new technologies.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2141s">[35:41]</a> It's all adaptation of existing technologies. I think it's all achievable and combined with,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2149s">[35:49]</a> you know, body part replacements or body replacements, you know, we could beat aging

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2156s">[35:56]</a> in a reasonable amount of time and with a reasonable budget that isn't crazy. So,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2164s">[36:04]</a> anyway, open to feedback and questions, Arcus one.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2169s">[36:09]</a> Fantastic. Thank you so very much. That was really interesting. And I love that. I think in your

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2175s">[36:15]</a> previous talk that you gave it for us, that was mostly really focused on the brain. And now, I

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2177s">[36:17]</a> think, you know, going through the whole path of the whole body first, I think they did a really

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2180s">[36:20]</a> great vision out for that. There's a ton of questions already. So, I'm going to keep mine

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2184s">[36:24]</a> very brief, aka, I'm going to ask them at the end in case we have time. But for now, we have

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2189s">[36:29]</a> Fiona, why don't you kick us off? All right. Thank you, Alison. And John, thank you so much.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2195s">[36:35]</a> This is fascinating as always. My question is about the brain. I think it's very interesting.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2202s">[36:42]</a> My question is about the brain replacement, right? Somewhere I read that a brain that doesn't evolve

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2208s">[36:48]</a> or grow up with a body where it maps how to control, let's say, fingers, limbs, and all that,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2216s">[36:56]</a> that if it's placed in another body, it will not know on the lower levels of the brain function

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2224s">[37:04]</a> what to do and that the organism will die. Also, I understand there are neurons outside the brain

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2232s">[37:12]</a> in the heart and in the stomach. And, you know, do these have memories that build up over a lifetime?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2238s">[37:18]</a> Can you address that? Yeah, I don't. There are certainly no conscious memories there. You know,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2245s">[37:25]</a> I like to use quadriplegics as an example. You know, it's they don't after, you know,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2252s">[37:32]</a> after their accident, for example, they don't lose certain memories that that would be in the neurons

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2260s">[37:40]</a> that are in the rest of the body, for example, right? So, they're still the same person,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2266s">[37:46]</a> you know, they may be a little bit depressed for a while about their new condition of the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2272s">[37:52]</a> paralyzed, but essentially it's the same person and they're not connected to any of the neurons

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2279s">[37:59]</a> in the rest of their body. So, in their digestive system, their sensory neurons, motor neurons,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2286s">[38:06]</a> you know, all the different types of neurons that occur in the body. So, I don't think those

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2291s">[38:11]</a> neurons really contribute to who we are in terms of our personality or at least not directly who

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2298s">[38:18]</a> we are in terms of our personality or self-identity. Yeah, the other question was, yeah, the connection,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2306s">[38:26]</a> again, yeah, so it's the same thing. You know, you can be disconnected neuronally from your body and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2312s">[38:32]</a> your brain doesn't die. And during development, yeah, the process is coincident with body growth

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2319s">[38:39]</a> and those neurons connecting to the body. But, you know, my understanding of the physiology of

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2328s">[38:48]</a> the neoporters is that it is super plastic and you can, for example, if you get a new limb,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2335s">[38:55]</a> your, that you can somehow communicate with your brain, you can, you incorporate that new limb as

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2343s">[39:03]</a> yours. So, if there's so much plasticity in the neocortex, it won't know the difference whether,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2350s">[39:10]</a> you know, if you get a synthetic limb, you know, because you lost a limb and you get a synthetic

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2356s">[39:16]</a> limb. If there's some proprioceptive feedback from that artificial limb, your brain, your cortex,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2364s">[39:24]</a> will adapt it as if it's your limb. So, I think there's enough plasticity there to, you know,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2371s">[39:31]</a> connect with the world normally. All right, thanks. Aaron. Hey, this is nitpicky,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2378s">[39:38]</a> but I feel like it's justified. So, the slide that you had for your arguments about what,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2383s">[39:43]</a> why the replacement should be done over other things for understanding aging and for biomarkers,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2390s">[39:50]</a> if we don't know how maintenance occurs for these replaced portions, at least at the tissue level,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2397s">[39:57]</a> then your same argument about a cell being in a bad environment leads it to being an old cell

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2402s">[40:02]</a> still applies to tissues. So, if we don't understand how maintenance occurs, then tissue level

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2407s">[40:07]</a> replacement, it might be that you replace the tissue and it fails within months because

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2412s">[40:12]</a> the maintenance systems were turned off. The logic that you outlined is all correct for whole body

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2418s">[40:18]</a> replacement if you grow like a whole entirely new body, but for tissue level replacement,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2423s">[40:23]</a> which is the title that you used on that slide, I don't think it's correct. So, if you can update

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2428s">[40:28]</a> that portion, that'd be good. Yeah, I did not say just tissue level or tissue or greater level.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2434s">[40:34]</a> I can't remember. Sometimes I use both, but yeah. So, I'm trying to be all inclusive about the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2439s">[40:39]</a> different approaches, but yeah, it's a good point, right? That if you have, and certainly if, you

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2445s">[40:45]</a> know, if you have a single organ, a young organ transplanted in an old person, it's unlikely to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2454s">[40:54]</a> do much good, right? Because failure of any other organ is going to kill not only that organ, but

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2460s">[41:00]</a> the whole person. The effect of the surrounding environment though to cells, I think it's something

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2467s">[41:07]</a> yeah, you could explore biomarkers, could be useful for that for sure. You know, the evidence

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2474s">[41:14]</a> even in the brain in humans over time is actually pretty good that the environment doesn't, you know,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2484s">[41:24]</a> hurt the new cells in that case that much. And if we're talking about tissue level replacements,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2491s">[41:31]</a> it should even be a lot less because the cells in the new tissue will be much more buffered from

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2497s">[41:37]</a> the rest of the environment because they're surrounded by the young tissue. But in the cases

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2503s">[41:43]</a> that I'm referring to again from back in the 80s when they were using fetal human brain tissue

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2510s">[41:50]</a> to treat Parkinson's, they did post-mortem analysis of these, you know, up to two decades later.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2517s">[41:57]</a> And even though those were naked cells in a diseased environment, you know, accelerated,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2524s">[42:04]</a> degenerative environment, after 16 years they still look pretty good and were still functioning.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2533s">[42:13]</a> And then after, you know, over two decades they were starting to show signs of pathology,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2540s">[42:20]</a> you know. And again, those are naked cells in the diseased environments

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2544s">[42:24]</a> and they were still, they still lasted, you know, close to a couple of decades.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2549s">[42:29]</a> You know, I think we can be relatively confident that the environment does matter of course,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2555s">[42:35]</a> like we mentioned because you do need to replace everything eventually and probably in a recent

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2562s">[42:42]</a> amount of time. But I think, you know, I think there's pretty good evidence and yes,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2568s">[42:48]</a> it could be confirmed with biomarkers that the tissue, young tissue is doing pretty well in an

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2575s">[42:55]</a> old environment. But we have a collaboration with Radin Vlaya where we started to work at this.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2581s">[43:01]</a> And yeah, you know, obviously that's, he works on biomarkers,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2585s">[43:05]</a> a big generic biomarkers and so I think it can still be useful. I would still argue that I don't

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2591s">[43:11]</a> think they're necessary though, but yeah. The next one we have John.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2596s">[43:16]</a> Hi John, nice presentation. I particularly like the way you outline the importance of

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2601s">[43:21]</a> extracellular aging as contrasted with cellular aging. I'd like to suggest a couple of alternative

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2610s">[43:30]</a> approaches that might run in parallel with your whole body or whatever replacement.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2616s">[43:36]</a> One is to genetically engineer fibroblasts and fibroblasts like cells so that they would go

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2625s">[43:45]</a> through more quickly and replace aging collagen, aging elastin and so forth. Right now they do it,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2632s">[43:52]</a> but they take around seven or eight years in most tissues to replace the collagen and if we could

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2640s">[44:00]</a> speed that up, that could be very therapeutic. The other is drug alternatives to breaking

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2647s">[44:07]</a> cross-links, glycation cross-links. There's one drug that was developed 25 years ago,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2655s">[44:15]</a> Algaebrium or ALT 711 and that works on one kind of principal cross-linked B-alpha diketone.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2663s">[44:23]</a> There's another principal cross-linked glucose pain, which so far we don't have a small molecule

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2668s">[44:28]</a> that can attack that. So I wanted to suggest that we expand your project to include some parallel

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2676s">[44:36]</a> projects. Yeah, I'll start with the second question first. Yeah, that is a molecular approach.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2681s">[44:41]</a> I wouldn't say it's impossible. I just think it's very difficult because of the complexity of the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2688s">[44:48]</a> damage. You know, there may be a couple of examples of drugs that can reverse cross-links, but

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2695s">[44:55]</a> you know, I'd be very surprised if they had no side effects because it's very hard for a drug to

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2700s">[45:00]</a> distinguish a very similar covalent bond in a bad protein versus a good protein.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2711s">[45:11]</a> In the case of alpha diketone, they don't exist inside the cell and they don't have any

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2719s">[45:19]</a> particular beneficial purpose. So breaking the alpha diketone links could be done without

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2727s">[45:27]</a> side effects. I've been taking Algaebrium for 24 years now, so I'm pretty sure it's pretty safe.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2734s">[45:34]</a> From your initial slide, of course, you showed that another problem is just breaking the elastin

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2741s">[45:41]</a> and breaking into the strands and that couldn't be fixed by Algaebrium, but it might be fixed if

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2746s">[45:46]</a> we can get a new kind of fibroblast that will chew up the old extracellular matrix and lay down

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2756s">[45:56]</a> new extracellular matrix in its wake. Yeah, and to your first point, I think that makes sense if

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2763s">[46:03]</a> it's something that doesn't exist normally, for sure, but there are so many other modifications

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2772s">[46:12]</a> that occur over time. Breaks, like you mentioned, but not only breaks, there's aggregates, there's

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2778s">[46:18]</a> lipid crosslinking, there's carbohydrate crosslinking, protein buslinking,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2783s">[46:23]</a> are different types. There's calcification, there's, you know, maybe you can imagine drugs

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2790s">[46:30]</a> for all of these, but again, because of the stochastic nature, I think it would be very difficult.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2797s">[46:37]</a> I agree 100%. I do think that it's important to work on this parallel at

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2804s">[46:44]</a> along with your project. Sure, sure. The other question with the fibroblast, engineer fibroblast,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2812s">[46:52]</a> some collagens turn over pretty, they're like, collagens are a big family, right? They're the

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2817s">[46:57]</a> most abundant proteins, you know, if you put them all together in our bodies, but there are a lot

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2822s">[47:02]</a> of different types of collagen. Some of them will turn over relatively fast, some very slowly,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2828s">[47:08]</a> and some almost not at all. But in the cases studied, whenever they started accumulating

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2835s">[47:15]</a> damage, they're no longer turned over by collagenases. So I'm not sure how putting in

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2842s">[47:22]</a> new fibroblasts is going to help that. They have the same collagenases to all fibroblasts.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2847s">[47:27]</a> I believe that the fibroblasts will actually chew up the old collagen, not just secreted

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2853s">[47:33]</a> collagens. That's my understanding. Yeah, I don't know how aggresive they are. Typically, it's more,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2862s">[47:42]</a> you know, immune derived cells that do the bulk of that, people warn their spibrosis. They certainly

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2869s">[47:49]</a> sound me alarm, fibroblasts become senescent, warns damage. But yeah, there might be something

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2876s">[47:56]</a> there I'm not familiar with that. There we are. Fibroblasts, you know, PCM.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2883s">[48:03]</a> We only have one minute and I really want to make sure that we also get your final words on what it

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2896s">[48:16]</a> is that you're doing right now, Jean, and how people can help and support you if they're interested

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2900s">[48:20]</a> in doing so. Because you showed a few slides about the company, but it would be useful to have some

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2905s">[48:25]</a> kind of clear action items for people to take away with. That would be great.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2909s">[48:29]</a> Yeah. Sorry, Micah. I saw you had your hand up. I would have loved to hear your question because

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2914s">[48:34]</a> you always have good questions. But maybe you can hit me later. Yeah, I think, you know,

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2921s">[48:41]</a> just being here discussing this is a positive thing. I'm happy to see that.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2930s">[48:50]</a> You know, we're looking for people who want to get involved with these replacement approaches.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2935s">[48:55]</a> You know, there's a lot of work to be done with progressive tissue replacement in the brains or

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2939s">[48:59]</a> anybody interested in that, please reach out to me, see if we can work together. That would be great.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2946s">[49:06]</a> But yeah, that's it. Thanks for having me. All right. Great. I'm hoping that we hear a lot

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2952s">[49:12]</a> more as you guys are gradually building out things and please do get in touch with Jean. I think his

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2957s">[49:17]</a> work is like absolutely fantastic. You've made so much progress in such a short time. I think there's

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2961s">[49:21]</a> so much to do as you laid out in the different categories. But I really think that you're moving

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2966s">[49:26]</a> really fast and it would be great if more people can like jump on and support this type of work.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2971s">[49:31]</a> Thank you so much. Thanks everyone for your amazing questions. I shared your Twitter here

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2975s">[49:35]</a> that people can contact you through, but you also shared your email address, I think in the final

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2978s">[49:38]</a> slide or in the first slide so that people definitely know how to contact you. If you have

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2982s">[49:42]</a> trouble contacting Jean, contact me to contact Jean. And yeah, I'm really excited for what you

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2986s">[49:46]</a> guys are building. And I think that could hardly be enough support, I think for this type of stuff

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsQCa8ws28&t=2991s">[49:51]</a> right now. We need to move fast. Thanks a lot.</pre>

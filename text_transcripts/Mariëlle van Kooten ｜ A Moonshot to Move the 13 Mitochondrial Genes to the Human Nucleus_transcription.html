  <h2 class="header">Mariëlle van Kooten ｜ A Moonshot to Move the 13 Mitochondrial Genes to the Human Nucleus_transcription</h2>
  <pre class="transcript"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=0s">[00:00]</a> So I'm gonna do something different. I'm not going to show you any data in this seven minute presentation

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=6s">[00:06]</a> But for the workshop session, I'll be asking you what data you would need to see in the next seven years

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=12s">[00:12]</a> For us to give you a gene therapy with 13 different genes in one go

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=18s">[00:18]</a> So this is an initiative we like to see as a research organization

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=23s">[00:23]</a> tackling one of the core nodes of aging

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=26s">[00:26]</a> And it starts right here at your DNA headquarters

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=29s">[00:29]</a> This is what we usually refer to when we talk about human DNA genes the human genome

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=35s">[00:35]</a> DNA headquarters what most people don't realize is that we have a second genome in each of our cells

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=40s">[00:40]</a> It controls what we refer to as the power plant our mitochondria. It's a mitochondrial DNA

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=45s">[00:45]</a> It's about 400,000 times smaller than the nuclear DNA, but it has several important functions

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=51s">[00:51]</a> So these two genomes are physically separated it's pretty crazy you have two genomes in two different locations in each of your cells

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=60s">[01:00]</a> While the nuclear genome is nicely protected in a nucleus with advanced DNA repair systems

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=65s">[01:05]</a> The mitochondrial DNA is stuck in a mitochondria and mitochondria have pretty archaic if any DNA repair systems

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=72s">[01:12]</a> also

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=73s">[01:13]</a> It has been argued although not everyone fully appreciates this to its full extent that mitochondrial deletions are actively selected

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=80s">[01:20]</a> For because mitochondrial genomes are governed by bacterial population genetics or originating from prokaryotes that at some point

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=88s">[01:28]</a> Got carried into our cells

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=90s">[01:30]</a> But most importantly as far as we're concerned is that the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes need to communicate they together form

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=99s">[01:39]</a> energy-producing complexes in the mitochondria

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=101s">[01:41]</a> So without this communication the cell is at loss and healthy mitochondria are central to almost any cellular process that you can think of

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=109s">[01:49]</a> Cellular health and mitochondria are intertwined and interconnected

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=114s">[01:54]</a> That also means that if something goes wrong in a communication for instance regarding mutations regarding deletions

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=121s">[02:01]</a> The cell health goes downhill

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=124s">[02:04]</a> We're talking about many different aspects one of which I'll highlight

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=128s">[02:08]</a> Late onset diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are carefully intertwined with mitochondria

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=133s">[02:13]</a> What kind of pushed us over the edge about half a year ago looking at this project and saying okay

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=139s">[02:19]</a> Should we do this? Yes, or no was a pretty recent discovery where Rodriguez Nuevo at all showed that human oocytes

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=147s">[02:27]</a> Actually carry some implications in natural evolution, too

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=151s">[02:31]</a> So nature kind of did two things regarding mitochondria and mitochondrial genomes

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=156s">[02:36]</a> First of all almost all genes have been moved to the nucleus in the course of human evolution and in the course of evolution

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=162s">[02:42]</a> Of any species that we sequence to date

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=165s">[02:45]</a> So more than a thousand of our mitochondrial genes are already in the nucleus

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=169s">[02:49]</a> We have only 13 left

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=170s">[02:50]</a> The second thing that nature did in one of the most important cell types that we cannot have aging in the course of our lifespan

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=176s">[02:56]</a> Human X cells is that nature silenced complex one complex one is the most

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=182s">[03:02]</a> Reactive oxygen species producing complex in our cells we produce energy

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=185s">[03:05]</a> We produce Ross and complex one in oocytes is actually silenced so that kind of pushed us over the edge and saying okay

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=192s">[03:12]</a> This is definitely something we need to look into and further investigate

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=196s">[03:16]</a> This is what we're going to do or place will place those 13 genes under more robust control

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=200s">[03:20]</a> No longer physically separated in the nuclear genome

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=204s">[03:24]</a> So we're consolidating the human genome and this might sound pretty easy

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=208s">[03:28]</a> I actually hear a lot like it's 13 genes. How hard can it be?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=212s">[03:32]</a> We don't call this a moonshot for nothing

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=215s">[03:35]</a> What we have seen over the past decades is that several teams actually we have one of the team members mark sitting over there

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=221s">[03:41]</a> He'll tell you that this is not easy several teams try this and we appreciate their efforts and we've learned a lot from what they've done

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=230s">[03:50]</a> What we do differently is two things for one

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=232s">[03:52]</a> We have a team that can tackle each of the regulatory levels involved in this problem

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=237s">[03:57]</a> We have a team that tackles genome biology all the way down to RNA biology all the way down to protein engineering and you need that

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=244s">[04:04]</a> Interdisciplinary team to tackle all these hurdles

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=247s">[04:07]</a> But more importantly we now finally have the tech to actually do this

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=251s">[04:11]</a> You need to do this systematically and at scale you cannot take just one gene and say yeah, maybe that works

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=256s">[04:16]</a> We'll try this with the other 12 you need to do this systematically at scale and for that

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=260s">[04:20]</a> We need several technologies that have only recently become available

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=264s">[04:24]</a> So we're talking about large scale DNA synthesis to try out several different types of mutations and mitochondrial genes

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=270s">[04:30]</a> We're talking about high throughput quality control to tackle each of those regulatory levels

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=274s">[04:34]</a> I mentioned we're talking about structure prediction alpha fold for instance

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=277s">[04:37]</a> Not just to model proteins that we haven't yet completely mapped but also to model newly designed proteins by our own hands

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=285s">[04:45]</a> And then finally we're talking about protein language models

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=288s">[04:48]</a> So machine learning driven gene design by which we take sequences from other organisms and say okay, what can they teach us?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=295s">[04:55]</a> So all of those different gene designs are put into gigantic gene design libraries that we then employ further

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=301s">[05:01]</a> What we do with them is build an integrated platform for cellular pathway engineering along three different milestones

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=308s">[05:08]</a> Milestone one we take synthetic mitochondrial DNA

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=312s">[05:12]</a> Strangely enough the human mitochondrial DNA has never been synthesized assembled and cloned never been done. It's so small never been done

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=319s">[05:19]</a> So what we do is we synthesize human mitochondrial DNA different versions plug that into mitochondria and plug those mitochondria back into cells and that way

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=327s">[05:27]</a> We establish a large platform of 13 different cell lines with knockouts of each of those mitochondrial genes

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=333s">[05:33]</a> We use that platform milestone to where we take all those gene design libraries that I just mentioned created by the state of the art

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=340s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=340s">[05:40]</a></a> tech and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=340s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=340s">[05:40]</a></a> Plug them into the nucleus and follow through which gene designs work best and finally we take the best working gene designs and put them

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=348s">[05:48]</a> Into the nucleus, but make sure they don't just work from the nucleus

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=353s">[05:53]</a> But I also work across genotypes because geographically our mitochondrial DNA is different

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=358s">[05:58]</a> But also work in a coordinated fashion in different cell types because different cell types have different energy needs

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=364s">[06:04]</a> Now the question to you is as follows

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=368s">[06:08]</a> So I've talked about three different milestones and I'm talking about as multi-year projects

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=372s">[06:12]</a> We're thinking seven to ten years before we can have a vector ready that what we say can actually work in a human body

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=379s">[06:19]</a> So these milestones are mostly scientific

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=382s">[06:22]</a> Quite fundamental but there is a lot of exciting spin-off potential and a question to you is what did you hear?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=388s">[06:28]</a> Did you hear me say custom mitochondrial genomes?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=391s">[06:31]</a> What resonated well with you was that the contemporary mitochondrial biology by which we can finally plug into all of those new tools

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=397s">[06:37]</a> CRISPR for instance for mitochondrial DNA to because that only works in a nucleus or did you hear me say, okay

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=403s">[06:43]</a> We can actually integrate novel pathways with multiple genes. It's not just that one or two gene therapy vector

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=408s">[06:48]</a> It's 13 genes and on so novel gene pathways integrated in a nuclear genome

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=414s">[06:54]</a> So we'd love to talk more with you and please feel free to ask us any question or email Chris Matiormi at founders at

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=421s">[07:01]</a> biohouse.bio

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=438s">[07:18]</a> Yeah, there are many different versions and strangely enough this has been not this hasn't been extensively researched

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=444s">[07:24]</a> There have been some older studies that also suggest that you can for instance

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=448s">[07:28]</a> Pretel

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=449s">[07:29]</a> cancerous mutations from mitochondrial DNA rather than nuclear DNA

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=453s">[07:33]</a> But there's remarkably little as known is also difficult to sequence mitochondrial DNA is difficult to isolate it

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=459s">[07:39]</a> There's also a lot of pieces of mitochondrial DNA that get transferred to the nucleus

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=463s">[07:43]</a> Without having a function a recent study on 66,000 patients in the UK biobank showed that this transfer happens all the time

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=471s">[07:51]</a> So it's there's some technical difficulties, but also a lack of interest. I would say because the focus has always been on the nuclear genome

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=488s">[08:08]</a> Yeah, I mean those are two questions I think right so one

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=491s">[08:11]</a> Why are they still there a lot of hypotheses happy happy to talk about that the other question is what?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=497s">[08:17]</a> Background do we need to use and which genes versions do we need to plug in what we actually plan to do is

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=504s">[08:24]</a> Not just have one donor from whose initial cells we work, but have a panel of donors are spread across geographical regions

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=511s">[08:31]</a> To indeed take this difference into account. It's a super interesting question from any different perspective. Yeah

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=518s">[08:38]</a> So you already mentioned that there are multiple

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=522s">[08:42]</a> Chanks of mitochondrial DNA sitting in the nuclear genome already. Well, you know more about that than I

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=528s">[08:48]</a> Have you thought of just turning those on?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=531s">[08:51]</a> Yeah, unfortunately, none of them are functional or so it appears

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=535s">[08:55]</a> But yes, there are some really interesting kind of findings that we can definitely use although most people argue this process is random

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=543s">[09:03]</a> Actually new mites as these pieces are called

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=546s">[09:06]</a> appear to be or play a large role in cancer too because they of course can insert themselves into

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=552s">[09:12]</a> Repressors for instance and then do that browse cause cancer

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=567s">[09:27]</a> No, it's not a V those the the size limits of that are are too restricting for this project

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=572s">[09:32]</a> So which will be about 10 KB. So we're talking the biggest gene vector that we've seen

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=577s">[09:37]</a> In this regard so this is happening in five to seven years from now in our estimates

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=582s">[09:42]</a> And we do think we can rely on gene therapy improving up to that point to what we would now use

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=588s">[09:48]</a> We already see what is possible

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=590s">[09:50]</a> But at very low efficiency is large serine recombinases which can insert large pieces of DNA and specific sites into the human genome

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=596s">[09:56]</a> We work with this in our own lab, too

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=599s">[09:59]</a> But we do think there needs to be some advancement in that area which we do expect in the next couple years

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=610s">[10:10]</a> Yes, so it ties a bit into the biomarker

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=613s">[10:13]</a> Area I would I would say but as I mentioned at the start what we need to hear from you is

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=620s">[10:20]</a> Why you wouldn't take this gene therapy vector in seven to ten years? So

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=626s">[10:26]</a> What's wrong and

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=627s">[10:27]</a> What data would you like to see because we can we're generating data now, right? We're doing this project

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=633s">[10:33]</a> We're removing this pushing this forward

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=635s">[10:35]</a> So we need to know from you what would convince you and possibly also the person your neighbor

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=640s">[10:40]</a> Who's not that interested in longevity, but perhaps is interested in health span. What data would they like to see?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=649s">[10:49]</a> So which data convinces you to use yourself

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI8BhdRaZnc&t=655s">[10:55]</a> for gene therapy clinical trials</pre>

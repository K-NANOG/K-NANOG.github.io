[00:00] Hi, Ron, welcome to Farsight's Biotech and Health Extension Group,

[00:03] sponsored by 100 Plus Capital.

[00:05] I'm really excited to have Jean-Auber back with us again.

[00:08] I think it's maybe your third appearance here in one of the seminars.

[00:11] And we've definitely had the luck to have you on for a lot of other workshops.

[00:15] I think we got in touch for the first time a few years ago when you wrote

[00:18] a really amazing book on the replacing paradigm to aging.

[00:22] And yeah, you've since done a lot of research and now also have a really

[00:26] wonderful company underway.

[00:27] And so we thought that it would be really fun to invite you back, given that

[00:30] replacing as now really mentioned, I think in the Amaranth Foundation and their

[00:35] longevity bottleneck assessment in the longevity biotech fellowship roadmap.

[00:39] And so I think it's just popping up a lot as a theme that is pretty undervalued

[00:43] within longevity, but like really promising.

[00:45] And so I'm really excited to have you here as to me, the pioneer who really

[00:49] like first set the whole entire kind of like sub-domain within aging on the map,

[00:53] at least for me.

[00:55] So thanks a lot for joining, John.

[00:56] And you'll be discussing replacement as the surest, fastest and cheapest way to

[00:59] building aging.

[01:00] And I will share a lot more about your bio in the chat, but without further

[01:04] ado, thanks a lot for joining and the stage is yours.

[01:07] Thanks so much, Alison, for having me again.

[01:10] I hope you can hear me well enough.

[01:14] Yeah, no, it's a pleasure to be back.

[01:16] And it's nice to see that replacement is growing in appreciation in the field.

[01:24] I think it's really because it deserves more attention and hope, maybe I'll

[01:29] convince you of that today.

[01:31] The title is a bit provocative, but I think it's totally defensible.

[01:37] I am happy to discuss this.

[01:39] I'll show a few slides and open to this being interactive and stimulating

[01:46] discussion about this.

[01:47] I'm going to be telling you about replacement and why I think it's the

[01:52] surest and fastest and also cheapest way of building aging.

[01:58] So first of all, why even consider a replacement as an approach to life

[02:03] extension?

[02:04] Let's start with an example.

[02:07] I got this from Anar Isnan who posted this recently, but I think it's a pretty

[02:12] illustrative picture.

[02:13] This is the same person decades apart.

[02:16] Some of you may recognize this person, Clint Eastwood, well-known actor and

[02:22] director, but this is what aging does.

[02:25] And what exactly is the difference that we're looking at here between the same

[02:31] person decades apart?

[02:33] And really what it is, is this accumulation of damage that occurs.

[02:39] It's stochastic.

[02:41] It's complex damage.

[02:43] I've listed some of the forms of damage that are accumulated to protein over

[02:47] time here, especially to long-lived percains.

[02:50] These are just classes of damage.

[02:52] So they each break down into different specific types of damage to the

[02:58] percains.

[02:59] So it's very complex.

[03:00] It happens somewhat randomly.

[03:02] This is not programmed.

[03:05] And most importantly, it's non-enzymatic, meaning it's not a biological process.

[03:11] It's really a physical process of the breakdown of long-lived proteins over

[03:18] time.

[03:19] And this is particularly important because approaches like drugs that are

[03:26] targeting biological pathways, aren't going to have much of an impact on the

[03:33] physical process.

[03:35] Also, we pretty much know all the genes in the genome now, and we can say with

[03:41] confidence that there are no genes encoded in our genome that recognize this

[03:47] damage or that encode the machinery that can deal with this damage.

[03:52] So genetic approaches and epigenetic approaches are not really going to have

[03:57] much of an impact.

[03:59] You might say, oh, there are, you know, for these extra cell or long-lived

[04:03] proteins that accumulate this damage, there are things like collagenase.

[04:08] It's known that collagenases stop working on these percains when they

[04:14] accumulate damage.

[04:15] So we're really left with nothing in the cell that can deal with this.

[04:21] And we know that this damage that accumulates around and outside of cells

[04:29] really has a big impact on the behavior of these cells in terms of whether

[04:33] they're behaving like young cells or old cells.

[04:36] So these are called heterochronic transplants, where you can take cells

[04:40] from a young tissue and then transplant them in an old tissue or vice versa.

[04:46] And what matters is that the cells are not going to be affected by the

[04:50] damage, but what matters is, you know, the end tissue that the cells end up in.

[04:55] So young cells in an old tissue behave like old cells, old cells in a young

[05:01] tissue behave like young cells.

[05:03] You know, we can kill ourselves trying to make these cells young again, which

[05:07] I would argue most of the longevity field is still focused on.

[05:11] And that's really not going to have much of an impact unless we deal with all

[05:16] the extra cellular components as well.

[05:19] The only way to do that at this point, or at least the most direct way is to do

[05:27] tissue level or greater replacements, you know, organ level, tissue level,

[05:31] whole replacements.

[05:35] You know, replacements are already used in the clinic.

[05:39] So there's not too much of a hurdle there.

[05:41] They're used to reverse damage caused by trauma, for example, or to cure

[05:47] certain diseases.

[05:49] But of course, they could be used for a lot more if we're thinking about life

[05:54] extension. And so I'll go over, you know, the different types of replacement

[05:59] approaches, both for the body and the brain and the pros and cons.

[06:03] And, you know, then this could potentially stimulate discussions about, you know,

[06:11] some of the I probably missed some of the pros and cons or definitely open

[06:16] to feedback on that.

[06:18] But first, I just wanted to make a sort of a side by side comparison again with

[06:22] much of the focus of the longevity field versus replacement.

[06:27] And so what are the advantages of taking a replacement approach?

[06:31] You know, a lot of us have heard that, oh, we have to understand aging before we

[06:36] can address it. Maybe, but not if you're using replacement where you do, you

[06:41] know, wholesale tissue replacement, all the damage is reversed at once and you

[06:46] don't really have to understand, you know, that thousands of things that are going

[06:50] wrong with aging to be able to reverse that aging biomarkers.

[06:55] A similar idea. You know, you can find limitless, limitless numbers of things

[07:01] that change with aging and call them biomarkers and say, you know, they're more

[07:05] or less important.

[07:07] But again, you don't really need that when you're doing tissue or greater level

[07:11] replacements. Another aspect of the focus of the longevity field is to really get

[07:18] the FDA to approve drugs as anti-aging drugs to get them on board with

[07:24] longevity research.

[07:26] And, you know, that's great.

[07:28] The more people we get on board with longevity research, the more we get

[07:32] government regulatory entities on board with the idea of life extension, the

[07:38] better. But for replacement, we don't actually need that.

[07:42] Replacements are generally approved.

[07:45] We've seen recently in the news, for example, a woman just got, you know, two

[07:51] pig organs transplanted at the same time, you know, kidney and thymus.

[07:56] And previously, other individuals have gotten also a xeno, xeno transplants for

[08:02] other organs.

[08:04] And of course, tissue engineered organs have been used in the clinic.

[08:08] And of course, a lot of donor to recipient organ transplants were in every body

[08:15] part has been transplanted that way in people.

[08:19] So the FDA is very much on board with these replacement strategies already, even

[08:25] though right now they're for disease and trauma.

[08:29] But in general, there's no restrictions there.

[08:33] Also, you know, getting more scientists interested.

[08:36] Again, that's very important.

[08:37] Nothing wrong with that.

[08:39] But in terms of replacement and this regenerative medicine approach, there's a

[08:44] ton of talent out there.

[08:46] It's one of the hottest areas of research in biology.

[08:49] And it's right now there are certainly sufficient talent there.

[08:54] It's just a matter of funding to hire them.

[08:58] The costs of, you know, going about, you know, extending lifespan by targeting all

[09:05] the different pathways involved and trying to modify them are indefinite at this point.

[09:12] This is largely based on work done by the LBF, the recent LBF roadmap, where they

[09:20] went out and talked to a lot of people about, you know, how much it would cost to

[09:24] get to particular milestones and how long it would take.

[09:28] And the cost is indeterminate because the timeline is indeterminate and there

[09:33] would be lots that would need to be addressed.

[09:37] In the case of replacement, you know, the milestones are very well defined for the

[09:42] different approaches, which we'll go over again in a minute.

[09:45] And so you can come up with cost estimates for that, which are, you know,

[09:51] significant rate less.

[09:53] Again, thank you to Leeav, Mark Hamelainen in particular for putting that together.

[10:00] Yeah.

[10:01] And then of course, you know, we don't even know with all these efforts.

[10:04] And I would argue that the probability of success with these efforts is very low.

[10:10] Whereas with replacement, we know if we succeed in doing it, that, you know, if

[10:15] you have an old body and replace it with a young body, you will have reversed aging.

[10:21] It's very high probability of success.

[10:24] Okay.

[10:25] So I don't know if there's any questions yet at this point.

[10:30] No, you're good.

[10:31] Good.

[10:32] All right.

[10:32] So let's start with replacement for the body.

[10:37] And there are several possible options of how we can go about it.

[10:42] In this case, there's biological, two broad categories, biological, non-biological.

[10:48] And then within the biological, you can do full body replacement.

[10:52] You can do all internal organs at once, or you can do more, you know, part by

[10:58] part, organ by organ replacement as well.

[11:01] So those are different approaches and we'll touch upon each of those.

[11:06] Then a non-biological, similarly, you could do potentially, you know, full body

[11:12] or all organs more part by part as well.

[11:16] And, you know, there's efforts going on for all these approaches and, you know,

[11:22] initial early proofs of concept that it can be done.

[11:27] So whole body replacement, you know, it's conceptually the most straightforward.

[11:33] I think it's also technically the most straightforward because it really

[11:36] doesn't involve any new tech, or it doesn't exist, the tech has to be adapted to this.

[11:44] But again, you know, the proof of concepts are there that the

[11:47] technology could work for this.

[11:49] But it would involve taking these primitive cells, germ cells, or other

[11:54] primitive stem cells, and just growing brainless bodies.

[11:59] Obviously we don't, wouldn't want, you know, this to be unethical in any way.

[12:04] And so if there is no brain there and it's just a body, it should be okay to use.

[12:10] And then, you know, he would use that to replace an old person's body with the young

[12:15] bind. So basically you would do a body transplant.

[12:20] So the head, the old head would be on a young bind.

[12:24] The pros for this are everything except the brain is young at once.

[12:30] You know, in one shot, there's potential for immune matching, depending on where

[12:36] these cells come from that you're using to make the body.

[12:40] And as I mentioned, it requires a little new tech, you know, proof of concept in

[12:45] preclinical models has been done for all these steps.

[12:50] The downsides are, you know, the social resistance.

[12:54] People will hear this and go, oh my God, this is crazy.

[12:58] And so I think that's a hurdle that needs to be addressed.

[13:05] And you also need to deal with the severed spinal cord when you do a head or brain

[13:10] transplant, although there to the technology is advanced or quite a bit to

[13:15] either bypass the spinal cord severing, for example, using brain machine

[13:21] interfaces, which are in clinical trials or biologically regrowing those

[13:26] connections where a lot of progress has been made as well.

[13:29] Our room cannot claim success on that yet.

[13:33] And also scaling is our consideration here that is not necessarily the easiest to address.

[13:41] So another approach that is being considered and explored is simply

[13:47] replacing all internal organs at once.

[13:51] It's actually not that complicated a surgery because there are not too many

[13:56] tubes at the top and the bottom of all these organs.

[14:00] So the surgery would appear to be doable, although that has not been tested yet.

[14:06] And, but it is an approach.

[14:08] The advantages in this case, instead of doing like the whole body transplant is

[14:13] that there's no spinal cord severing and there's still possibility for immune

[14:18] matching and also requires little new tech.

[14:22] But here too, you know, the social acceptance of such an approach might

[14:28] require, you know, a fair amount of, you know, convincing that this is great to be

[14:34] saving lives and, and, and no one's getting hurt.

[14:37] And, you know, that this is really the right thing to do.

[14:41] But that is definitely, I think, something that would still need to be addressed.

[14:45] In this case, not all body parts are replaced.

[14:49] It's just the internal organs, which you could argue would likely have benefits on health.

[14:56] But, you know, and I put this in the cons because it's not all body parts.

[15:00] And I would worry though, because, you know, even like the limbs, for example, that are

[15:06] aging over time, put you at risk of death as their blood vessels, you know, get old,

[15:13] you're more likely to get clots, which can result in pulmonary embolisms and kill you,

[15:19] for example.

[15:20] You know, maybe it would extend a maximal lifespan, which would be great.

[15:24] You know, not necessarily.

[15:25] You still have to consider those other body parts.

[15:28] Scaling again here too, is not something that is obvious, although, you know, there are

[15:35] solutions.

[15:36] So the other approach is to do more organ by organ or part by part.

[15:41] And we've seen a lot of evidence of this in a clinic already, as I mentioned, you know,

[15:47] recently, you know, transplants where you basically use normal developmental processes

[15:55] to generate organs of the right size, which is why pinks are used.

[16:00] And then if you can deal with the immune incompatibility, then you can use this for

[16:07] transplantation.

[16:08] So that's an approach that's getting a lot of attention now and is being used in certain

[16:14] cases in clinical trials.

[16:17] With, you know, certain amount of success, those organs are working in humans, but, you

[16:24] know, still ways to go there in terms of reducing the immune rejection risk among other things.

[16:32] And in this particular case with xenotransplantation, one of the downsides is, you know,

[16:36] you're still using animals for this.

[16:39] Although, again, there, there may be a way around it because, you know, in preclinical

[16:46] studies, we do know how to make non-sentient bodies.

[16:50] And so that could be a way of resolving that issue.

[16:54] In any case, there's also other approaches like blastocyst complementation.

[16:59] So in this case, you would be growing human organs in another species like the pig, again,

[17:05] for size compatibility.

[17:07] But in this case, the organs would be made of human cells.

[17:12] And then, of course, there's what, you know, the field has been working on for quite some

[17:17] time with fairly slow progress is tissue engineering.

[17:22] And that's where you basically make de novo organs in the lab that can be used for

[17:28] transplantation.

[17:30] And there's been some success, you know, like the bladder that's already probably a couple

[17:35] of decades ago or at least a decade and a half.

[17:38] And, you know, those are functioning in humans quite well.

[17:42] And so that's a success.

[17:44] But those have been far and few in between.

[17:47] And I think the advantage of these other approaches like the xenotransplantation or growing

[17:54] in human organs in the pig, for example, is that they don't require really other than

[18:02] genetic engineering for the immune compatibility.

[18:04] They don't require tissue engineering because it's really letting nature or the developmental

[18:11] process occur on its own as it normally does.

[18:16] And I think that's a concept that is really going to take over her replacement field over

[18:23] time is just using normal developmental processes to generate the tissues, the organs, the

[18:31] organs that we want for replacement.

[18:34] Because we don't, again, have to understand all the steps or, you know, we don't have to

[18:39] be able to de novo make things from scratch.

[18:43] They will just grow and develop naturally as they normally would, you know, when we were

[18:47] a piece is growing up and becoming kids and growing up into adults.

[18:53] Yeah.

[18:54] In this case, the advantages, again, no spinal cord severing scaling could be easier.

[19:00] Again, depends on which of these approaches you're taking.

[19:05] And in all cases, it's already happening.

[19:08] So, there's early proof of concept that this can work.

[19:12] The downsides, if you're going to do it this way, it means a lot of surgeries, which,

[19:20] you know, again, puts you at greater risk of complications.

[19:24] And it's hard to replace all body parts this way, although conceivable and you could.

[19:30] And the immune mismatching, again, that can be different depending on the approaches here.

[19:36] But, you know, it is a challenge with these using these different parts.

[19:43] All right.

[19:45] So, there's also a non-biological approach to replacement where you can do replace, like,

[19:52] all the organs of the body with synthetic replacements.

[19:56] And, you know, I only know one lab who's doing this, but they seem to be doing quite well.

[20:04] This is, you know, the BrainX from Narzostanzla, but, you know, and so they have this completely

[20:13] synthetic artificial system that replaces the need for all our organs.

[20:19] And, you know, of course, because this is engineered, it could also easily be

[20:23] replaced when it gets old or the parts can be maintained much more like an old car

[20:29] where you can keep it going indefinitely if you change all the parts.

[20:33] So, this is an interesting approach that, you know, I'm keeping an eye on.

[20:38] We should all keep an eye on.

[20:39] The advantages are easy scaling and there's opportunities here for

[20:44] brain machine interfaces to combine that with controlling limbs, for example.

[20:51] I think that's an advantage.

[20:52] I also put it in the disadvantages because brain machine interfaces are required in this case to,

[20:59] you know, be able to interact with the outside world.

[21:02] And so, the state of the art for these brain machine interfaces are getting pretty good

[21:09] for the machine reading your intentions and being able to control limbs, whether they're

[21:16] artificial or your own limbs, if you're paralyzed, for example.

[21:20] So, they're getting pretty good at that, or they are pretty good at that already.

[21:24] But there's very little in the way of sensory input to the brain using machine interfaces.

[21:33] And so, that's an area I think where before this can be useful, that would need to be addressed.

[21:40] And then, you know, potentially, you still have to worry about the unbarricaded parts

[21:45] that are biological that you haven't replaced.

[21:49] But, you know, that could potentially be addressed, again, using synthetic body parts

[21:56] like synthetic limbs, for example, which become very sophisticated and perform, you know,

[22:02] almost as well or maybe in some cases better than our natural limbs, certainly better than

[22:09] our natural limbs as we get old.

[22:12] So, that's also an approach that I think is of interest.

[22:15] And of course, there is a fully artificial heart that's being used now in people.

[22:22] There's also kidney-like bioreactors that are in preclinical state, parts are working pretty well.

[22:30] And other organs potentially also follow suit.

[22:34] So, you can do this also, this replacement with synthetics,

[22:38] either part by part or the whole thing.

[22:43] And, you know, the brain remains biological, maybe other parts of the body would be biological as

[22:49] well if you were doing this in combination with biological replacements.

[22:54] So, there's a bio-machine, you know, the compatibility is not always perfect.

[23:01] And so, there's a risk there.

[23:05] I think the technology can stand to improve a little bit.

[23:08] It's gotten pretty good with blood vessels, which are really important because, you know,

[23:12] if the biological vessel detaches from the synthetic one, it can be pretty disastrous.

[23:18] But I think a lot of progress has been made there.

[23:20] But, you know, overall, again, still some progress to be made.

[23:24] So, that's the body replacement approaches.

[23:28] I'm going to move to the brain, but unless anybody has questions in the meantime.

[23:33] There's no question.

[23:34] There's one, but I think we can move on and then we'll take them back.

[23:37] One by one.

[23:38] Okay.

[23:39] Okay.

[23:39] Great.

[23:41] So, brain tissue replacement.

[23:43] Obviously, we can't replace the whole brain at once.

[23:46] It would be a different person.

[23:48] So, we have to consider how we do this.

[23:50] And the only way would be progressive tissue replacement.

[23:55] And again, in the, you know, in terms of FDA approval in the clinic, this doesn't seem to be

[24:02] a problem using cells or we don't call them tissues yet, but there are combinations of,

[24:09] you know, scaffolds and cells that are being used.

[24:12] So, you call them very primitive tissues that are used in people already.

[24:16] So, you know, there's no roadblock there in terms of getting it to the clinic.

[24:20] Here are some successes in terms of treating Parkinson's and epilepsy with our new cells.

[24:27] These companies like Aspen, Neuroscience, Blue Rock, Neurona.

[24:34] Aspen not yet.

[24:35] They have FDA approval, but everybody knows, anticipates that their cells are going to be

[24:40] as good as Blue Rock's without the need for immune suppression because they're autologous.

[24:47] But these companies have shown safety in the clinic and efficacy of their cells in these brain

[24:54] transplants. And, you know, they're also commercially very viable successes.

[25:00] So, the companies are worth a lot at this point.

[25:03] Again, because it works, their cells work to reverse, you know, these are in the case

[25:08] of Parkinson's, atrial disease. And then, of course, in the case of epilepsy,

[25:13] just their neurological disease. That's just to say that, you know, that there's a path to

[25:20] getting this implemented in the clinic. But there's two reasons why progressive brain tissue

[25:27] replacement makes sense. One is that it appears that we'll be able to add new tissue to the brains

[25:36] and have it functionally integrate with the existing brain. This was shown most nicely,

[25:45] you know, already eight years ago in Germany by Magda Wiener-Gurtz's lab showing that

[25:50] transplanted embryonic precursors differentiate into neurons that integrate remarkably well

[25:57] with the adult neural circuitry. So, very promising result there. And then this was repeated

[26:04] and continues to be repeated by a bunch of different labs, including ours, just showing that,

[26:10] you know, you can get really good integration of new neurons in the brain. Whether you're

[26:16] transplanting the associated cells or organoids, they all seem to do quite well.

[26:24] Yeah, I just have some examples here and they all basically say the same thing,

[26:29] that the neurons integrate really well. However, we're not there yet in terms of those neurons

[26:36] truly being functional because there's things missing. So, these are typically a single neuronal

[26:44] type or at least a single neuronal class, a single class of neurons, for example,

[26:50] excitatory neurons and not inhibitory neurons. And so, we know that without the full complement

[26:57] of neuronal subtypes, that tissue or that graft cannot process information normally.

[27:04] It also lacks structure. So, we know the structure is really important for the wiring within the

[27:10] tissue or in this case, within the graft. And so, the cells are all mixed up, which they are in all

[27:16] these applications, including in the work read down and published. You're not going to get

[27:21] information processing that's useful to the host. We still have work to do. But again, this is,

[27:29] you know, doesn't require development of new technologies. It just requires doing things right.

[27:36] But so, this shows at least in principle that we can add, should be able to add new tissue

[27:42] to the old brain and have it functionally integrate. But important to progressive tissue

[27:47] replacement is not just the addition of new tissue, but the removal of old tissue, which

[27:53] inevitably lead to strokes and other bad things. So, we need to get rid of that tissue.

[27:59] And we already have a proof of concept in the clinic that oral tissue can be removed without

[28:09] loss of its information content or interruption of function or personality or self-identity

[28:17] in cases slow growing benign gliomas that occur in people of any age, but typically more so as

[28:25] you get older. So, even in patients in their 70s, for example, they get these tumors that

[28:30] grow from a pinpoint out and eat away a certain area of the brain or the neoportex in particular.

[28:39] And let's say it eats away at the language center over the course of an extended period of time.

[28:46] Those individuals don't lose the ability to speak because language gets re-encoded in a

[28:51] different part of the neoportex because of the progressive nature of the construction of the

[28:57] tissue and because the person is using language every day. If you have a stroke in the language

[29:03] center, it's a catastrophic event. There's no time for the relocation or the plasticity to occur

[29:10] and you lose language. But these tumors show that you can, you know, lose tissue slowly over time

[29:17] without losing the information content in it, without you even realizing that it's happening.

[29:23] So, this is the other half of the equation. We can add tissue and we can progressively remove

[29:30] tissue without loss of information content. So, great. You know, how might we go about doing this?

[29:37] There are different here too, just like for the body, for the brain, there are different approaches.

[29:43] There's an engineering approach where, again, you're in all cases inspired by the normal

[29:50] developmental process. So, you want to recapitulate that normal developmental process.

[29:56] And this is something that my group is working on, engineering a fetal-like neocortical tissue,

[30:05] which is very well defined after you're in, you know, extensive omics analysis to know what

[30:11] precursor cell types are present there, what are the extracellular signals and scaffolding

[30:17] components that are necessary for those cells to develop into a well-structured, mature tissue

[30:25] that can process information normally. So, we've done this analysis, we can generate all the

[30:31] components. Sorry, this is a bit of a plug for the work we're doing, but it's only a couple of slides.

[30:39] And so, we've actually generated a proto tissue now, you know, has the structure and the precursor

[30:45] cell types that we want, and we've started testing this in animals. Again, still a lot of work to do,

[30:52] but, you know, we think it's possible to engineer this fetal-like tissue to give rise to structured,

[30:59] functional adult tissue. It's not the only approach though, although it does have advantages in terms

[31:06] of surgical implementation, because since we're designing the tissue, we can design the shape

[31:11] and adjust it to each lesion site, for example, and it's much easier to scale than the approaches

[31:20] I'm going to tell you about now. The disadvantage is it's harder to get it right, because compared

[31:27] to the advantages I'm going to show you now as well, and those approaches are basically to use

[31:35] normal development to obtain the same precursor tissue, in this case not engineered, but derived

[31:41] from earlier developmental stages. So, you may have heard of these ex-utero synthetic fetuses

[31:48] that different groups are working on. So, they start with human pluripotent stem cells in culture,

[31:54] which, you know, standard practice now in terms of deriving those from individuals,

[31:59] and then developing them into these sort of early fetuses. And the big advantage here is that those

[32:08] tissues are more likely to be authentic. This is also scalable, which is nice. The disadvantage

[32:16] is the need potentially for synthetic uteri to get to older stages where we can actually collect

[32:25] this fetal-like tissue for our grafts instead of engineering it, for example,

[32:30] and that hasn't been developed yet. Otherwise, you know, it may be hard to get these

[32:38] synthetic fetuses to develop to a stage that's old enough that we could collect tissue without

[32:45] necrosis setting in. You know, people are working on it and they're smart people and hopefully

[32:51] they'll succeed here. Another way is to use interspecies chimeras. There were two papers that

[32:58] just came out this month showing that you could grow, I think there was some rat cells in mice

[33:05] and get, in both cases, it's not complete. So, it's not clean. I think there's ways that you

[33:11] could make this a lot cleaner. But in red here is a rat brain tissue in an otherwise mouse brain.

[33:19] And in another study, they show a similar thing, although the degree of chimeras in a way is worse.

[33:26] I think this could be improved and you could imagine growing human fetal tissue, brain tissue

[33:36] in another species to obtain a source for transplantation and repair.

[33:42] And then you could use human fetal tissue itself. You know, this has been used for quite some time,

[33:49] you know, for Parkinson's, for example, in 1987, 88, and then ever since, human fetal brain tissue

[33:58] has been used to treat Parkinson's in particular. And, you know, one could imagine but using human

[34:05] fetal tissue could be a source or tissue for transplantation. Disadvantage, you know, there is

[34:11] some social opposition to using human fetal tissue, even though at this point, you know, there are not

[34:17] even any functional neurons there. So, it's really not, you know, there's no sentience. And the

[34:23] scaling is also, you know, problematic. But in any case, that's an alternative approach where we know

[34:30] the tissue is truly authentic. So, I think that's pretty much it. For the brain, this is just a

[34:35] cartoon showing how, you know, the addition and removal of all tissue could be implemented.

[34:42] We have ways, although they haven't been adapted to our purposes yet, but we have ways of

[34:48] progressively silencing brain tissue from a pinpoint out that would mimic a artificial

[34:56] glioma because we wouldn't want to use the glioma to silence tissue as an example, I'm sure, of your

[35:02] earlier. But we have ways of doing that. So, you could progressively silence parts of the brain

[35:08] while putting in your fetal tissue in other areas and allowing progressive silencing and tissue

[35:17] development and integration occur coincidentally and repeating this a few times. So, that's a

[35:24] way of doing that. I went over that fast, you know, happy to go over it in more detail.

[35:31] It's very interesting. But the point is, you know, none of this seems, requires new technologies.

[35:41] It's all adaptation of existing technologies. I think it's all achievable and combined with,

[35:49] you know, body part replacements or body replacements, you know, we could beat aging

[35:56] in a reasonable amount of time and with a reasonable budget that isn't crazy. So,

[36:04] anyway, open to feedback and questions, Arcus one.

[36:09] Fantastic. Thank you so very much. That was really interesting. And I love that. I think in your

[36:15] previous talk that you gave it for us, that was mostly really focused on the brain. And now, I

[36:17] think, you know, going through the whole path of the whole body first, I think they did a really

[36:20] great vision out for that. There's a ton of questions already. So, I'm going to keep mine

[36:24] very brief, aka, I'm going to ask them at the end in case we have time. But for now, we have

[36:29] Fiona, why don't you kick us off? All right. Thank you, Alison. And John, thank you so much.

[36:35] This is fascinating as always. My question is about the brain. I think it's very interesting.

[36:42] My question is about the brain replacement, right? Somewhere I read that a brain that doesn't evolve

[36:48] or grow up with a body where it maps how to control, let's say, fingers, limbs, and all that,

[36:56] that if it's placed in another body, it will not know on the lower levels of the brain function

[37:04] what to do and that the organism will die. Also, I understand there are neurons outside the brain

[37:12] in the heart and in the stomach. And, you know, do these have memories that build up over a lifetime?

[37:18] Can you address that? Yeah, I don't. There are certainly no conscious memories there. You know,

[37:25] I like to use quadriplegics as an example. You know, it's they don't after, you know,

[37:32] after their accident, for example, they don't lose certain memories that that would be in the neurons

[37:40] that are in the rest of the body, for example, right? So, they're still the same person,

[37:46] you know, they may be a little bit depressed for a while about their new condition of the

[37:52] paralyzed, but essentially it's the same person and they're not connected to any of the neurons

[37:59] in the rest of their body. So, in their digestive system, their sensory neurons, motor neurons,

[38:06] you know, all the different types of neurons that occur in the body. So, I don't think those

[38:11] neurons really contribute to who we are in terms of our personality or at least not directly who

[38:18] we are in terms of our personality or self-identity. Yeah, the other question was, yeah, the connection,

[38:26] again, yeah, so it's the same thing. You know, you can be disconnected neuronally from your body and

[38:32] your brain doesn't die. And during development, yeah, the process is coincident with body growth

[38:39] and those neurons connecting to the body. But, you know, my understanding of the physiology of

[38:48] the neoporters is that it is super plastic and you can, for example, if you get a new limb,

[38:55] your, that you can somehow communicate with your brain, you can, you incorporate that new limb as

[39:03] yours. So, if there's so much plasticity in the neocortex, it won't know the difference whether,

[39:10] you know, if you get a synthetic limb, you know, because you lost a limb and you get a synthetic

[39:16] limb. If there's some proprioceptive feedback from that artificial limb, your brain, your cortex,

[39:24] will adapt it as if it's your limb. So, I think there's enough plasticity there to, you know,

[39:31] connect with the world normally. All right, thanks. Aaron. Hey, this is nitpicky,

[39:38] but I feel like it's justified. So, the slide that you had for your arguments about what,

[39:43] why the replacement should be done over other things for understanding aging and for biomarkers,

[39:50] if we don't know how maintenance occurs for these replaced portions, at least at the tissue level,

[39:57] then your same argument about a cell being in a bad environment leads it to being an old cell

[40:02] still applies to tissues. So, if we don't understand how maintenance occurs, then tissue level

[40:07] replacement, it might be that you replace the tissue and it fails within months because

[40:12] the maintenance systems were turned off. The logic that you outlined is all correct for whole body

[40:18] replacement if you grow like a whole entirely new body, but for tissue level replacement,

[40:23] which is the title that you used on that slide, I don't think it's correct. So, if you can update

[40:28] that portion, that'd be good. Yeah, I did not say just tissue level or tissue or greater level.

[40:34] I can't remember. Sometimes I use both, but yeah. So, I'm trying to be all inclusive about the

[40:39] different approaches, but yeah, it's a good point, right? That if you have, and certainly if, you

[40:45] know, if you have a single organ, a young organ transplanted in an old person, it's unlikely to

[40:54] do much good, right? Because failure of any other organ is going to kill not only that organ, but

[41:00] the whole person. The effect of the surrounding environment though to cells, I think it's something

[41:07] yeah, you could explore biomarkers, could be useful for that for sure. You know, the evidence

[41:14] even in the brain in humans over time is actually pretty good that the environment doesn't, you know,

[41:24] hurt the new cells in that case that much. And if we're talking about tissue level replacements,

[41:31] it should even be a lot less because the cells in the new tissue will be much more buffered from

[41:37] the rest of the environment because they're surrounded by the young tissue. But in the cases

[41:43] that I'm referring to again from back in the 80s when they were using fetal human brain tissue

[41:50] to treat Parkinson's, they did post-mortem analysis of these, you know, up to two decades later.

[41:57] And even though those were naked cells in a diseased environment, you know, accelerated,

[42:04] degenerative environment, after 16 years they still look pretty good and were still functioning.

[42:13] And then after, you know, over two decades they were starting to show signs of pathology,

[42:20] you know. And again, those are naked cells in the diseased environments

[42:24] and they were still, they still lasted, you know, close to a couple of decades.

[42:29] You know, I think we can be relatively confident that the environment does matter of course,

[42:35] like we mentioned because you do need to replace everything eventually and probably in a recent

[42:42] amount of time. But I think, you know, I think there's pretty good evidence and yes,

[42:48] it could be confirmed with biomarkers that the tissue, young tissue is doing pretty well in an

[42:55] old environment. But we have a collaboration with Radin Vlaya where we started to work at this.

[43:01] And yeah, you know, obviously that's, he works on biomarkers,

[43:05] a big generic biomarkers and so I think it can still be useful. I would still argue that I don't

[43:11] think they're necessary though, but yeah. The next one we have John.

[43:16] Hi John, nice presentation. I particularly like the way you outline the importance of

[43:21] extracellular aging as contrasted with cellular aging. I'd like to suggest a couple of alternative

[43:30] approaches that might run in parallel with your whole body or whatever replacement.

[43:36] One is to genetically engineer fibroblasts and fibroblasts like cells so that they would go

[43:45] through more quickly and replace aging collagen, aging elastin and so forth. Right now they do it,

[43:52] but they take around seven or eight years in most tissues to replace the collagen and if we could

[44:00] speed that up, that could be very therapeutic. The other is drug alternatives to breaking

[44:07] cross-links, glycation cross-links. There's one drug that was developed 25 years ago,

[44:15] Algaebrium or ALT 711 and that works on one kind of principal cross-linked B-alpha diketone.

[44:23] There's another principal cross-linked glucose pain, which so far we don't have a small molecule

[44:28] that can attack that. So I wanted to suggest that we expand your project to include some parallel

[44:36] projects. Yeah, I'll start with the second question first. Yeah, that is a molecular approach.

[44:41] I wouldn't say it's impossible. I just think it's very difficult because of the complexity of the

[44:48] damage. You know, there may be a couple of examples of drugs that can reverse cross-links, but

[44:55] you know, I'd be very surprised if they had no side effects because it's very hard for a drug to

[45:00] distinguish a very similar covalent bond in a bad protein versus a good protein.

[45:11] In the case of alpha diketone, they don't exist inside the cell and they don't have any

[45:19] particular beneficial purpose. So breaking the alpha diketone links could be done without

[45:27] side effects. I've been taking Algaebrium for 24 years now, so I'm pretty sure it's pretty safe.

[45:34] From your initial slide, of course, you showed that another problem is just breaking the elastin

[45:41] and breaking into the strands and that couldn't be fixed by Algaebrium, but it might be fixed if

[45:46] we can get a new kind of fibroblast that will chew up the old extracellular matrix and lay down

[45:56] new extracellular matrix in its wake. Yeah, and to your first point, I think that makes sense if

[46:03] it's something that doesn't exist normally, for sure, but there are so many other modifications

[46:12] that occur over time. Breaks, like you mentioned, but not only breaks, there's aggregates, there's

[46:18] lipid crosslinking, there's carbohydrate crosslinking, protein buslinking,

[46:23] are different types. There's calcification, there's, you know, maybe you can imagine drugs

[46:30] for all of these, but again, because of the stochastic nature, I think it would be very difficult.

[46:37] I agree 100%. I do think that it's important to work on this parallel at

[46:44] along with your project. Sure, sure. The other question with the fibroblast, engineer fibroblast,

[46:52] some collagens turn over pretty, they're like, collagens are a big family, right? They're the

[46:57] most abundant proteins, you know, if you put them all together in our bodies, but there are a lot

[47:02] of different types of collagen. Some of them will turn over relatively fast, some very slowly,

[47:08] and some almost not at all. But in the cases studied, whenever they started accumulating

[47:15] damage, they're no longer turned over by collagenases. So I'm not sure how putting in

[47:22] new fibroblasts is going to help that. They have the same collagenases to all fibroblasts.

[47:27] I believe that the fibroblasts will actually chew up the old collagen, not just secreted

[47:33] collagens. That's my understanding. Yeah, I don't know how aggresive they are. Typically, it's more,

[47:42] you know, immune derived cells that do the bulk of that, people warn their spibrosis. They certainly

[47:49] sound me alarm, fibroblasts become senescent, warns damage. But yeah, there might be something

[47:56] there I'm not familiar with that. There we are. Fibroblasts, you know, PCM.

[48:03] We only have one minute and I really want to make sure that we also get your final words on what it

[48:16] is that you're doing right now, Jean, and how people can help and support you if they're interested

[48:20] in doing so. Because you showed a few slides about the company, but it would be useful to have some

[48:25] kind of clear action items for people to take away with. That would be great.

[48:29] Yeah. Sorry, Micah. I saw you had your hand up. I would have loved to hear your question because

[48:34] you always have good questions. But maybe you can hit me later. Yeah, I think, you know,

[48:41] just being here discussing this is a positive thing. I'm happy to see that.

[48:50] You know, we're looking for people who want to get involved with these replacement approaches.

[48:55] You know, there's a lot of work to be done with progressive tissue replacement in the brains or

[48:59] anybody interested in that, please reach out to me, see if we can work together. That would be great.

[49:06] But yeah, that's it. Thanks for having me. All right. Great. I'm hoping that we hear a lot

[49:12] more as you guys are gradually building out things and please do get in touch with Jean. I think his

[49:17] work is like absolutely fantastic. You've made so much progress in such a short time. I think there's

[49:21] so much to do as you laid out in the different categories. But I really think that you're moving

[49:26] really fast and it would be great if more people can like jump on and support this type of work.

[49:31] Thank you so much. Thanks everyone for your amazing questions. I shared your Twitter here

[49:35] that people can contact you through, but you also shared your email address, I think in the final

[49:38] slide or in the first slide so that people definitely know how to contact you. If you have

[49:42] trouble contacting Jean, contact me to contact Jean. And yeah, I'm really excited for what you

[49:46] guys are building. And I think that could hardly be enough support, I think for this type of stuff

[49:51] right now. We need to move fast. Thanks a lot.

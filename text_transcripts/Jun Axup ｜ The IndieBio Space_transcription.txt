[00:00] Awesome. Thanks so much everyone for coming. This is the IndyBio space. If

[00:05] you're not familiar IndyBio is a startup accelerator. We've been around for eight

[00:08] years now. You can see our labs and whatnot downstairs. We funded over I

[00:14] guess a hundred and eighty companies at this point spanning human health and

[00:19] climate change, planetary health, so yeah all kinds of different areas. We've had a

[00:25] handful of longevity related companies. We generally are the first check-in

[00:29] at about five hundred twenty five thousand dollars and then companies are

[00:34] here for four months and then go on into the world and continue on. Yeah that's

[00:40] about IndyBio. Feel free to come chat with me if you want. Also personally I

[00:44] have actually left IndyBio. I am now at E11 Bio which is a brain connectomic

[00:49] focused research organization. So if you want to talk about brain longevity come

[00:54] chat with me later too.

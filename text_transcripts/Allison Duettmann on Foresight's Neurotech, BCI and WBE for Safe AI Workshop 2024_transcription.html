  <pre class="transcript"><a href="https://youtu.be/ulWd_3OysrY?si=GFA_vilXX67CXUDU&t=0s">[00:00]</a> Hi, I'm Alison Dippmann. I'm the CEO of Forsyth Institute, a Bay Area nonprofit that advances high impact technology for beneficial futures.

<a href="https://youtu.be/ulWd_3OysrY?si=GFA_vilXX67CXUDU&t=7s">[00:07]</a> We have a variety of different grants, prizes, fellowships, workshops, seminars throughout the year.

<a href="https://youtu.be/ulWd_3OysrY?si=GFA_vilXX67CXUDU&t=11s">[00:11]</a> And this one is one of my favorite ones.

<a href="https://youtu.be/ulWd_3OysrY?si=GFA_vilXX67CXUDU&t=13s">[00:13]</a> This one was on newer technologies, banking, region interfaces and whole brain innovation for safe AI development.

<a href="https://youtu.be/ulWd_3OysrY?si=GFA_vilXX67CXUDU&t=19s">[00:19]</a> So we got about 60 researchers, scientists, entrepreneurs, funders and activists in one room about two days to figure out what are new technology paths for safe AI.

<a href="https://youtu.be/ulWd_3OysrY?si=GFA_vilXX67CXUDU&t=29s">[00:29]</a> How can we compare them in terms of their impact on AI, in terms of their risks, in terms of their benefits, in terms of the timeline and costs that it requires to get there?

<a href="https://youtu.be/ulWd_3OysrY?si=GFA_vilXX67CXUDU&t=37s">[00:37]</a> And then finally, what can we do as a community to advance these projects with new R&D mechanisms?

<a href="https://youtu.be/ulWd_3OysrY?si=GFA_vilXX67CXUDU&t=42s">[00:42]</a> I'm also really happy to announce that many projects developed at this workshop, but also beyond, so possibly you, can now apply for funding.

<a href="https://youtu.be/ulWd_3OysrY?si=GFA_vilXX67CXUDU&t=49s">[00:49]</a> We have an AI safety grant that already focuses a lot on newer tech, and we're probably going to expand that now in the next few weeks to cover a lot more areas with a lot more funding.

<a href="https://youtu.be/ulWd_3OysrY?si=GFA_vilXX67CXUDU&t=57s">[00:57]</a> We're also going to announce a new $1 million LoFi emulation price.

<a href="https://youtu.be/ulWd_3OysrY?si=GFA_vilXX67CXUDU&t=61s">[01:01]</a> So if any of this sounds interesting, please go to our website, check out our workshop reports, check out our prizes, grants, fellowships, and please get engaged.</pre>

[00:00] They say two heads are better than one, so what about two billion?

[00:15] Today's topic is Hiveminds and Networked Intelligence, and I should start by saying

[00:20] they are not entirely the same thing.

[00:22] Indeed, while Hiveminds is mostly a subcategory of networked intelligence, it has a lot of

[00:27] subcategories of its own too.

[00:30] Probably the best known example of a Hivemind from fiction is the Borg from Star Trek, and

[00:35] those fellows are sufficiently horrifying that it gives Hiveminds a pretty bad reputation.

[00:41] To be fair though, they are rarely presented in a positive light in fiction.

[00:46] We'll try to look at some positive aspects and examples today, but to be honest I think

[00:51] I'd rather jump off a cliff than be part of most versions of them so I'm probably

[00:55] not a neutral spokesman.

[00:57] Networked Intelligence is another story, as a broad category, and networked intelligence

[01:02] itself is one of the three types of intelligence and possible paths to superintelligence we've

[01:08] discussed.

[01:09] One of the others is speed intelligence, when the mind is the same except sped up.

[01:14] That is simple enough and we've talked about it extensively in other episodes.

[01:18] Networked Intelligence and quality intelligence, which is rather hard to define beyond the

[01:22] difference between a lone genius who solves a problem a roomful of experts could not,

[01:27] are both types we've spent less time on and today we'll fix that for the former.

[01:32] The first key thing though about networked intelligence is that it's already something

[01:35] we have, and I don't mean in the way humans themselves are arguably a colony organism

[01:41] composed of many different types of cells and organs.

[01:44] Unlike the most integrated forms of Hivemind, you are not a bigger intelligence composed

[01:48] of smaller intelligences so I think we have to exclude individual humans as an example

[01:53] of a Hivemind.

[01:55] Community and networked intelligence is a bit tricky, in order to avoid trivial examples

[01:59] like a herd of animals with limited communication.

[02:03] Normally with futuristic concepts I always encourage folks to avoid definitions that

[02:07] would include ourselves since that tends to indicate the definition is bad.

[02:12] You and I are not cyborgs, it's nice to point out how things like our glasses or tooth

[02:17] fillings or similar can be argued to be a mechanical augmentation of a human, but it's

[02:22] really not what we mean by cyborg so you probably have a bad definition if it includes modern

[02:27] humans.

[02:28] Similarly, humans are not what we mean when we say networked intelligence or Hivemind,

[02:32] but human civilization was built by us becoming a simple networked intelligence.

[02:37] Moreover, we recognize such things exist and it's implicit whenever we refer to a group

[02:42] or organization that are beyond classic family and genetic groupings.

[02:47] This company, that sports team, that church or village or city or country, we do regard

[02:52] as an entity in its own right.

[02:54] A network being a bunch of ropes tied together to create a net, usually with nodes or knots,

[02:59] it's probably not too surprising the definition of network is pretty hazy too.

[03:04] But for today's context we'll say the simplest thinking network would be several

[03:08] individual nodes, human minds in this case, connected together exchanging information.

[03:14] Already we've been doing this since before there were humans, since even the most basic

[03:19] of body language and noises inside some pack of animals is an intentional exchange of information.

[03:25] If you want to stretch the point, you can argue that even two simple organisms exchanging

[03:29] DNA to make a new one is pretty sophisticated communication, and you can really stretch

[03:34] the point and include even a simple unicellular organism that reproduces by mitosis, by dividing

[03:39] itself, arguing it is a giant factory or many interdependent machines.

[03:44] It's easy to forget just how complex such bacteria are, but it is better to think of

[03:48] them as giant metropolises full of molecules as people and buildings than some tiny simple

[03:54] organism barely bigger than an atom, after all, each cell usually contains trillions

[03:59] of atoms.

[04:00] Like I said though, we have to beware definitions of new concepts so broad as to be meaningless,

[04:06] not because it is inaccurate, just inconvenient and not helpful.

[04:10] I will just place the simplest of networked intelligences at the invention of language,

[04:15] as that seriously jumped up both the bandwidth and integrity of those signals and as a byproduct

[04:20] allowed far more short term and focused specialization.

[04:24] We see limited specialization in almost any group of cooperating animals, and we see intense

[04:29] specialization in things like insect hives, but the sheer amount of fast and accurate

[04:35] data that can be exchanged through human language allows us to train people with identical

[04:40] DNA to perform very specific tasks not strongly shaped by their biology, and we see that

[04:45] strongly with the emergence of cities, from which we get the word civilization in the

[04:50] first place.

[04:51] Very many people each specialized in very different tasks which could not possibly allow

[04:56] their survival in isolation just doing that specialized task, all grouped together for

[05:01] fast exchange of information and supplies.

[05:04] Any definition being a bit arbitrary, I will set this as the simplest example of networked

[05:09] intelligence for humans.

[05:11] It also represents a huge paradigm shift and increase in resources and abilities.

[05:17] Same as basic communication and tool use made humans jump up over other animals, the rise

[05:21] of cities and civilizations gave a huge edge.

[05:25] We have tons of technological improvements that make individual people more effective,

[05:29] we've had many more that just let us increase how many people we can have alive and healthy,

[05:34] our carrying capacity.

[05:37] However many of these inventions were such boons because they improved the network.

[05:42] Roads and bridges to connect rural areas to cities and cities to other cities, carrying

[05:46] not just food and supplies but allowing the movement of people, ideas, and information.

[05:51] Ships, railroads, highways, postal systems, radios, telephones, and these days the internet,

[05:58] all can be viewed as an amplification and augmentation of basic human speech, which

[06:03] allowed two people fairly near each other to exchange complex concepts quickly and accurately.

[06:10] Even the invention of writing, which allowed communication not only over distance but over

[06:14] time itself, improved this basic human network so that it could include dead people.

[06:20] Long after they were gone, even from memories of the next generation or two who met them

[06:24] and spoke to them, writing allowed us to incorporate non-living humans into the human network and

[06:30] the modern internet has allowed us to include computers and databases into that network

[06:34] too.

[06:35] We don't really think of ourselves as networked intelligence, some actual entity called humanity,

[06:41] but even just those of us old enough to remember when the internet did not exist, and even

[06:46] being exposed to it gradually so it lacked an explosive moment of transition, can see

[06:51] a clear difference in the civilization we have now as opposed to then.

[06:56] Technological changes happen so fast and frequently these days that we are a bit immune to seeing

[07:00] how they changed us, but it has still happened.

[07:04] I wanted to note that though because a bit like cybernetics, networked intelligence is

[07:08] one of those things where it happens gradually enough that we might just keep moving the

[07:13] bar.

[07:14] Folks a few centuries from now might be shot through with tons of devices, cloud-storing

[07:18] memories outside their head and routinely talk to people by just thinking their direction

[07:22] with the technological equivalent of telepathy, and still be talking about how in the future

[07:27] people might be cyborgs or network their minds together, not like us of course.

[07:33] But no matter how integrated human minds might get to be, the human itself is not the networked

[07:38] intelligence, it's just a note of it, whether it's an individual or not.

[07:43] Bob is not the networked intelligence of New York City, he's just a component of it.

[07:48] On this subject of networks and hive minds, we are obviously very interested in what happens

[07:53] to the individual, if they still continue to exist or not, or are free or not, or have

[07:58] privacy or not, but the individual is not the network, even if it is a key or irreplaceable

[08:05] component.

[08:06] Who is the network?

[08:08] The network is the network.

[08:10] We have a thought problem that's fairly interesting for developing this notion.

[08:13] We've talked a lot about copying a human mind onto a computer substrate where the processors

[08:19] emulate neurons.

[08:20] That's an intuitive enough concept for folks, but you can just as easily, well not easily,

[08:26] sit millions of people down with pencil and paper and have them perform all those same

[08:30] calculations that a computer is doing, storing each result on paper and walking over to hand

[08:35] each new bit to another calculator.

[08:38] We can envision your neurons doing this to make you, we can envision computer chips doing

[08:43] this to make you, but there is something passing strange about the idea of a ton of people

[08:48] cracking all the calculations out manually, including folks looking at the scenery and

[08:53] jotting down data to be sent to a giant skyscraper full of cubicles manned by the team that makes

[08:59] up your eyes and optic nerve.

[09:01] Yet by the same logic as the neurons or the computer emulation, that would be you, and

[09:07] in this case you would be a networked intelligence, all those people are your nodes.

[09:12] You don't, as with the traditional hive mind, have access to their thoughts, you can't

[09:17] control them, they are not indeed wired into your mind at all.

[09:21] We could also replace them with a giant ant colony, a literal hive, that wasn't calculating

[09:27] but performed those operations far more stupidly and simply, pushing colored or scented grains

[09:32] around to serve as your bits and signals.

[09:35] I like this example, where people or ants, our usual example of a hive mind, are cracking

[09:40] out calculations to run your mind because it both shakes up the notion of thinking of

[09:44] an uploaded mind on a computer as essentially just a substitute brain, a black box doing

[09:49] the work, and highlights that such a thing doesn't actually have to be composed of

[09:54] the actual minds of its nodes in an intrusive manner.

[09:58] I think it is also easier to picture some place like New York City or Tokyo as a potential

[10:02] real separate entity with thoughts when you've just tried to wrap your head around a million

[10:07] people with pencil and paper running your mind.

[10:11] I don't think I would ever categorize one of these as a true networked intelligence

[10:15] unless the mind being generated was actually smarter than the individual components each

[10:19] were, at least at some task, and while some group of people working on a problem together

[10:24] might come up with ideas faster and better than an individual could, and maybe even ones

[10:29] no individual would have thought of, it's not really exhibiting much intelligence itself.

[10:35] Of course in fiction it often is because its individual members have usually become drooling

[10:40] morons.

[10:41] At best one can justify this with the assumption that collective mind is using every spare

[10:46] bit of processing power, up to and including the bits that process stuff like optical signals

[10:51] so that people can walk right by the drones without even being seen maybe, but this is

[10:55] mostly just bad writing.

[10:58] Or very good writing.

[10:59] In the case of Star Trek's Borg, the writers are presumably more focused on making them

[11:03] a dreadful inhuman enemy that dehumanizes people, and nothing better shows that than

[11:08] folks stumbling around without apparent self-awareness like a zombie, so I won't knock the writers

[11:13] from a story standpoint, just a logical and science standpoint.

[11:18] The Borg are idiots, individually and collectively, and I doubt that demonstrates an actual hive

[11:24] mind properly even if I love them as villains.

[11:27] I think I preferred Unity, a parody of the Borg from the cartoon Rick and Morty, where

[11:32] the titular character Rick gets the hive mind Unity drunk and it comments how I probably

[11:36] shouldn't be trying to run 200,000 pediatric hospitals and 12 million deep fryers in that

[11:42] state, and it's a key point about such hive minds, that if you're composed of lots of

[11:46] individual components designed for doing such things on their own you probably shouldn't

[11:51] be running them.

[11:53] Humans not only have components of ourselves we control subconsciously, but plenty of bits

[11:57] that operate with no control whatsoever.

[11:59] I don't need to tell my DNA to unzip and replicate, though it might be handy to be

[12:04] able to tell it when to do that and when not to.

[12:07] Indeed we do have some regulation methods inside the body and cancer can result when

[12:12] that breaks down.

[12:13] I'd imagine a hive mind could develop the equivalent of cancer, and if it layers up

[12:17] a lot of minds, some minds that supervise this or that, it would have to worry not just

[12:22] about individual members leaving or attacking if they did, but also some minds smaller hive

[12:27] minds rebelling or breaking away.

[12:30] Obviously the more autonomy you have at the lower levels the more of an issue that would

[12:34] be, my kidneys have never tried to declare independence or stage a revolt.

[12:39] Hive minds though could easily end up undergoing such breakaways or mitosis as a form of reproduction.

[12:45] In the absence of instantaneous communication it might need to as well.

[12:49] I mentioned a few episodes back in Digital Death that a human brain spread out to the

[12:53] size of a planet but with its signals switched over to light speed ones would process at

[12:58] the same rate as a normal human mind.

[13:01] Get out beyond that and you'll either need some form of FTL communication or you will

[13:05] start suffering time lag issues.

[13:08] So spreading a hive mind over multiple planets, let alone solar systems, would seem a serious

[13:13] limitation.

[13:14] I tend to be skeptical about us ever inventing any form of FTL, but even if we grant it for

[13:20] the moment, a lot of fictional and theoretical FTL methods are simply faster than light,

[13:26] not instantaneous, or have some serious bandwidth issues.

[13:30] You can probably run an interstellar empire on dial-up modem speeds, the old Battletech

[13:35] and Mechwarrior franchise did that, but I can't see running a hive mind that way.

[13:40] This is one possible Fermi Paradox solution that gets kicked around too, that aliens don't

[13:45] spread out from their homeworld much because they converged to being hive minds or get

[13:50] replaced by singular entities like a super-intelligent planet-sparling computer.

[13:54] I tend not to bring it up in Fermi Paradox discussions because it's not a good one,

[13:59] but it is of interest today.

[14:00] It's not a good one because you can't assume every civilization does this, you can't

[14:05] assume none would be willing to subdivide to found a new small hive mind in another

[14:09] system, and it still suffers from the Dyson Dilemma, in that you can build Dyson Swarms

[14:14] around your own home star and as we saw in the Mega Earths episode, you can't just

[14:18] keep building those up with resources brought in from elsewhere until it is galactic mass

[14:23] and hovering just above the critical density to turn into a black hole, either as a birch

[14:27] planet or a truly huge Dyson Swarm of Dyson Swarms.

[14:32] I think most hive minds would be willing to reproduce by making a new one elsewhere, but

[14:37] they might not like the idea of essentially making a rival, and for that matter they might

[14:42] need a certain minimum number of people just to make existence bearable for those colony

[14:46] splinters.

[14:47] In Kevin J. Anderson's Saga of the Seven Sons you've got a limited hive mind, the

[14:52] Erdurens, who tend to need to do everything big, including their defense fleets, just

[14:57] to have enough of them in one place to stay effective and sane.

[15:00] The geth from the Mass Effect franchise had that issue too.

[15:04] If that was hard to overcome, you'd probably need to bring resources back rather than expand.

[15:10] Now there's the question of who would go out and retrieve those resources from around

[15:13] the galaxy, but any hive mind that can't design an automated mining vessel obviously

[15:18] came out a loser on that deal when it became one.

[15:21] It's the same issue with folks living in virtual realities, they might not want to

[15:26] abandon their paradise to go harvest resources far away, but they shouldn't have to.

[15:31] If you can make simulated paradises, it implies you can make something smart enough to decently

[15:36] mimic people to talk with in that paradise, so programming a ship to go gather stuff and

[15:41] bring it back ought to be child's play, and one would tend to think a hive mind could

[15:45] do it too, especially since they presumably had to be pretty good with intelligence and

[15:49] computers to make their hive mind in the first place.

[15:53] That skips those that naturally evolved, who are often shown as being awful with computers

[15:58] because they never developed them.

[16:00] We get that with Morning Light Mountain in Peter Hampton's Commonwealth Saga and with

[16:04] the Buggles or Formics in Ender's Game, and lots of other insect hive examples.

[16:09] The former, Morning Light Mountain, cannot naturally speak faster than light as most

[16:14] the fictional examples can so it does have a decent head for electronics and cybernetics

[16:19] but still never developed computers much.

[16:21] In Ender's Game the Buggles do have instant communication and telepathy they naturally

[16:26] evolved, indeed humans back-engineered their own interstellar communication off this.

[16:31] Sort of.

[16:32] They knew it could be done since they could tell by watching bugger ships react to things

[16:36] faster than the speed of light should have permitted them to witness it, and knowing

[16:39] it could be done humanity then figured it out.

[16:42] It is implied they need a Queen reasonably nearby for this to work though, as a sort

[16:46] of central node, though in later books it is stressed that the Queen's body is just

[16:51] one more drone to her, albeit a critical one, and that she isn't really the Queen

[16:55] or maybe even the Hive but more like our example earlier where your intelligence was run by

[16:59] ants.

[17:01] We also get a retcon about the individual Buggles actually having intelligence of their

[17:04] own.

[17:05] Orson Scott-Card is pretty good about consistent canon by and large but some explanations changed

[17:11] over the series, tweaked for consistency I assume.

[17:14] I remember when I did the Stupid Aliens episode and mentioned the book I irritated some folks

[17:19] discussing the Buggles, that's not what it was in the book, and kept having to remind

[17:23] folks that it isn't a book, it is a series of around 20 novels and short stories written

[17:28] over 30 years, and that they weren't saying I was wrong, they were saying the author was.

[17:33] Always a problem in science fiction when stuff needs retconning, or maybe didn't but got

[17:38] it anyway, and a lot of folks were irritated when Alice Krieg showed up in Star Trek First

[17:43] Contact, the film not the episode, as the Borg Queen, but it didn't bother me too

[17:48] much personally.

[17:50] The Borg originally spoke with one voice out of a thousand mouths, cold and alien and unified,

[17:56] like a sociopathic chorus, so having a single queen talking seemed wrong.

[18:01] But to be fair the Borg originally were going to be an insectoid hive race but they didn't

[18:06] have the budget, so we get the black leather body horror look that seems like something

[18:10] out of Clive Barker's Hellraiser franchise, so changes happen and it gave the audience

[18:15] a central focus for the villain.

[18:16] There's also no reason a hive can't have a mouthpiece, it's actually inefficient

[18:21] to have a thousand people saying the exact same thing, and a hive doesn't have to be

[18:26] homogenous with every member having the same function and status, insect hives aren't

[18:30] like that after all, it could be a meat puppet to use as a collective voice or even a semi-independent

[18:36] system.

[18:37] Now the Borg are horrifying in their own right, but the usual thing that bugs people

[18:42] about them is that membership tends not to be optional.

[18:46] Even in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, the rather benevolent Hive Mind of Gaia, which

[18:50] still has modest individuality for its members, is plotting galactic takeover and by conscription

[18:56] not volunteers.

[18:58] It was not a popular move with most fans either, myself included, and is often guessed as the

[19:03] reason why all future books in the series were set before the incident.

[19:08] Nonetheless there are tons of examples of good hive minds in science fiction, especially

[19:12] when telepathy seemed to be an omnipresent feature even in hard science fiction novels.

[19:17] A trend I'm glad finally died off in the last couple decades, but common or not, rarely

[19:23] do I hear folks speaking of them with enthusiasm.

[19:26] Pretty much the only member of a hive mind in fiction I like is Neville Clavaine from

[19:30] the Revelation Space series.

[19:32] It probably helps he's a viewpoint character who joins semi-voluntarily, never upgrades

[19:37] his implants from the earlier versions that were less connected, and is often on bad terms

[19:41] with his own faction, the Conjoiners, so he doesn't exactly cheerlead for them.

[19:46] They also don't indiscriminately spread and assimilate folks involuntarily either.

[19:51] Interestingly Clavaine's faction in the books is often in conflict with the other

[19:55] faction of humanity that is closest to being a hive mind too, the Demarchists.

[20:00] They are more of a bunch of intelligences who are networked, so to speak, as like most

[20:04] people they have a ton of mental implants but one of theirs, and the key one for their

[20:09] specific civilization, is one that tries to go straight democracy, no representatives,

[20:14] by having everyone vote on almost everything.

[20:17] Sort of like if every bill in congress got text messages to you for a vote, only as best

[20:22] as I can tell the implants allow them to do it mostly subconsciously and even asleep.

[20:26] I assume the implants in everyone's head know them individually well enough to guess

[20:30] how they'd respond.

[20:32] Forgetting the specific mechanics, that is kind of the ideal of most versions of democracy

[20:37] and its parallels.

[20:39] Everyone gets a say in what happens because everyone has an investment in the outcome

[20:43] and a right to self-determination, so networking folks to make news and details easier to get

[20:48] and absorb to make more informed decisions seems ideal.

[20:53] If you're not really taken too far you get a hive mind where nobody gets any say

[20:57] in anything because there's no individuality left over.

[21:00] The other big issue is the privacy one, and that's a serious issue of the future even

[21:05] when you're not telepathically linked to other people.

[21:08] However in the networked intelligence case, short of a hive mind, I do think that is just

[21:14] an artifact of telepathy in science fiction.

[21:17] We associate telepathy as reading people's minds, not just the equivalent of a phone

[21:22] or internet connection, so a method using that will understandably make you figure all

[21:27] those minds can read each other and freely look around or even merge.

[21:31] Again part of why I don't like telepathy in fiction, made up non-science makes for

[21:35] bad extrapolations of the future.

[21:38] Folks end up picturing some mind-eating hive or a bunch of folks joining hands around a

[21:42] drum circle to meditate and combine their souls.

[21:46] My computer, and thus me, is connected to the internet and to you, obviously, or you

[21:51] couldn't hear me now.

[21:52] I've never noticed my smartphone trying to merge into my brain even when I'm holding

[21:56] it next to my head or my computer trying to eat my neighbors.

[22:00] I can read my files from other computers in my house or on a network but only the ones

[22:05] I've shared.

[22:06] When you're doing this stuff with mystical telepathy that presumably can't be done

[22:10] or it takes special effort and training.

[22:12] But when you do it with technology you have to understand how it all works, how brains

[22:17] and memory function, to do it in the first place.

[22:20] So segmenting things off or only sharing specific chosen bits is possible from the outset.

[22:26] And if I want people to know what my schedule is, I can make that open just like my Google

[22:31] Calendar, or if I want only my doctor to be able to look at my medical status, I can do

[22:36] that too.

[22:37] So I think when we're talking about a technological route to a more networked intelligence, we

[22:42] do not necessarily have to discard privacy and individuality to gain the many obvious

[22:47] benefits.

[22:48] You also probably don't have to go the all in or out option, one size fits all.

[22:54] Living in a city traditionally cuts down privacy a bit, hence many of us prefer the peace and

[22:58] solitude of the country, doesn't mean we're divorced from civilization.

[23:02] So too, one can presumably set up such a network to allow people variable involvement to fit

[23:08] their tastes, in general and at the moment.

[23:12] Also just like civilization you could enjoy sub-networks, I'm part of humanity and the

[23:17] US and my state of Ohio and my little village and dozens of various related and unrelated

[23:22] social or professional groups, my level of involvement in each varies, and I can adjust

[23:28] my commitment.

[23:29] You could have a human overmind with say the sub-mind of Ohio, which was both a separate

[23:34] entity and part of the Earth Mind at the same time, and how much so might fluctuate, as

[23:39] might its membership, with some joining or leaving and involving themselves to varying

[23:44] degrees.

[23:45] Werner Wiench explores this notion with a race called the Tynes in his classic novel

[23:50] A Fire Upon the Deep, where we see small group minds of often just a few critters that often

[23:55] switch members who are not really individuals on their own.

[23:59] There are a lot of options for this in fiction, but I would tend to guess people who predict

[24:03] this as an eventuality for humans are semi-correct.

[24:07] Just my guess but the error being made is that folks don't want to give up their privacy

[24:11] and individuality and must eventually mature to be okay with that, and I personally don't

[24:16] see that as more mature or necessary, that you have to sacrifice privacy or individuality

[24:22] to enjoy the benefits of a greater degree of networking and group cooperation, though

[24:28] I could easily see a lot of folks choosing that route and so long as admission is voluntary

[24:33] more power to them.

[24:35] Obviously if you're too interdependent it makes it hard to get out there and settle

[24:38] the galaxy and we'll be looking at a first step to that next week in Colonizing the

[24:42] Oort Cloud, which contains tons of potential places for us to colonize but usually so far

[24:48] apart even compared to planets that no unified hive mind would be viable.

[24:53] The week after that, we'll leave the solar system and continue to explore the problems

[24:57] with unification, especially with light speed limitations, in Interstellar Empires, and

[25:03] Then we'll finish out 2017 by heading out of the galaxy and asking if it is even possible

[25:08] to settle other galaxies in a universe without faster than light travel.

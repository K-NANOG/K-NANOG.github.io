  <pre class="transcript"><a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=0s">[00:00]</a> They say two heads are better than one, so what about two billion?

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=15s">[00:15]</a> Today's topic is Hiveminds and Networked Intelligence, and I should start by saying

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=20s">[00:20]</a> they are not entirely the same thing.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=22s">[00:22]</a> Indeed, while Hiveminds is mostly a subcategory of networked intelligence, it has a lot of

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=27s">[00:27]</a> subcategories of its own too.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=30s">[00:30]</a> Probably the best known example of a Hivemind from fiction is the Borg from Star Trek, and

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=35s">[00:35]</a> those fellows are sufficiently horrifying that it gives Hiveminds a pretty bad reputation.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=41s">[00:41]</a> To be fair though, they are rarely presented in a positive light in fiction.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=46s">[00:46]</a> We'll try to look at some positive aspects and examples today, but to be honest I think

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=51s">[00:51]</a> I'd rather jump off a cliff than be part of most versions of them so I'm probably

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=55s">[00:55]</a> not a neutral spokesman.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=57s">[00:57]</a> Networked Intelligence is another story, as a broad category, and networked intelligence

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=62s">[01:02]</a> itself is one of the three types of intelligence and possible paths to superintelligence we've

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=68s">[01:08]</a> discussed.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=69s">[01:09]</a> One of the others is speed intelligence, when the mind is the same except sped up.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=74s">[01:14]</a> That is simple enough and we've talked about it extensively in other episodes.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=78s">[01:18]</a> Networked Intelligence and quality intelligence, which is rather hard to define beyond the

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=82s">[01:22]</a> difference between a lone genius who solves a problem a roomful of experts could not,

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=87s">[01:27]</a> are both types we've spent less time on and today we'll fix that for the former.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=92s">[01:32]</a> The first key thing though about networked intelligence is that it's already something

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=95s">[01:35]</a> we have, and I don't mean in the way humans themselves are arguably a colony organism

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=101s">[01:41]</a> composed of many different types of cells and organs.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=104s">[01:44]</a> Unlike the most integrated forms of Hivemind, you are not a bigger intelligence composed

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=108s">[01:48]</a> of smaller intelligences so I think we have to exclude individual humans as an example

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=113s">[01:53]</a> of a Hivemind.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=115s">[01:55]</a> Community and networked intelligence is a bit tricky, in order to avoid trivial examples

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=119s">[01:59]</a> like a herd of animals with limited communication.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=123s">[02:03]</a> Normally with futuristic concepts I always encourage folks to avoid definitions that

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=127s">[02:07]</a> would include ourselves since that tends to indicate the definition is bad.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=132s">[02:12]</a> You and I are not cyborgs, it's nice to point out how things like our glasses or tooth

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=137s">[02:17]</a> fillings or similar can be argued to be a mechanical augmentation of a human, but it's

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=142s">[02:22]</a> really not what we mean by cyborg so you probably have a bad definition if it includes modern

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=147s">[02:27]</a> humans.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=148s">[02:28]</a> Similarly, humans are not what we mean when we say networked intelligence or Hivemind,

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=152s">[02:32]</a> but human civilization was built by us becoming a simple networked intelligence.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=157s">[02:37]</a> Moreover, we recognize such things exist and it's implicit whenever we refer to a group

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=162s">[02:42]</a> or organization that are beyond classic family and genetic groupings.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=167s">[02:47]</a> This company, that sports team, that church or village or city or country, we do regard

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=172s">[02:52]</a> as an entity in its own right.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=174s">[02:54]</a> A network being a bunch of ropes tied together to create a net, usually with nodes or knots,

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=179s">[02:59]</a> it's probably not too surprising the definition of network is pretty hazy too.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=184s">[03:04]</a> But for today's context we'll say the simplest thinking network would be several

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=188s">[03:08]</a> individual nodes, human minds in this case, connected together exchanging information.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=194s">[03:14]</a> Already we've been doing this since before there were humans, since even the most basic

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=199s">[03:19]</a> of body language and noises inside some pack of animals is an intentional exchange of information.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=205s">[03:25]</a> If you want to stretch the point, you can argue that even two simple organisms exchanging

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=209s">[03:29]</a> DNA to make a new one is pretty sophisticated communication, and you can really stretch

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=214s">[03:34]</a> the point and include even a simple unicellular organism that reproduces by mitosis, by dividing

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=219s">[03:39]</a> itself, arguing it is a giant factory or many interdependent machines.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=224s">[03:44]</a> It's easy to forget just how complex such bacteria are, but it is better to think of

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=228s">[03:48]</a> them as giant metropolises full of molecules as people and buildings than some tiny simple

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=234s">[03:54]</a> organism barely bigger than an atom, after all, each cell usually contains trillions

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=239s">[03:59]</a> of atoms.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=240s">[04:00]</a> Like I said though, we have to beware definitions of new concepts so broad as to be meaningless,

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=246s">[04:06]</a> not because it is inaccurate, just inconvenient and not helpful.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=250s">[04:10]</a> I will just place the simplest of networked intelligences at the invention of language,

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=255s">[04:15]</a> as that seriously jumped up both the bandwidth and integrity of those signals and as a byproduct

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=260s">[04:20]</a> allowed far more short term and focused specialization.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=264s">[04:24]</a> We see limited specialization in almost any group of cooperating animals, and we see intense

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=269s">[04:29]</a> specialization in things like insect hives, but the sheer amount of fast and accurate

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=275s">[04:35]</a> data that can be exchanged through human language allows us to train people with identical

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=280s">[04:40]</a> DNA to perform very specific tasks not strongly shaped by their biology, and we see that

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=285s">[04:45]</a> strongly with the emergence of cities, from which we get the word civilization in the

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=290s">[04:50]</a> first place.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=291s">[04:51]</a> Very many people each specialized in very different tasks which could not possibly allow

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=296s">[04:56]</a> their survival in isolation just doing that specialized task, all grouped together for

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=301s">[05:01]</a> fast exchange of information and supplies.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=304s">[05:04]</a> Any definition being a bit arbitrary, I will set this as the simplest example of networked

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=309s">[05:09]</a> intelligence for humans.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=311s">[05:11]</a> It also represents a huge paradigm shift and increase in resources and abilities.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=317s">[05:17]</a> Same as basic communication and tool use made humans jump up over other animals, the rise

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=321s">[05:21]</a> of cities and civilizations gave a huge edge.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=325s">[05:25]</a> We have tons of technological improvements that make individual people more effective,

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=329s">[05:29]</a> we've had many more that just let us increase how many people we can have alive and healthy,

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=334s">[05:34]</a> our carrying capacity.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=337s">[05:37]</a> However many of these inventions were such boons because they improved the network.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=342s">[05:42]</a> Roads and bridges to connect rural areas to cities and cities to other cities, carrying

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=346s">[05:46]</a> not just food and supplies but allowing the movement of people, ideas, and information.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=351s">[05:51]</a> Ships, railroads, highways, postal systems, radios, telephones, and these days the internet,

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=358s">[05:58]</a> all can be viewed as an amplification and augmentation of basic human speech, which

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=363s">[06:03]</a> allowed two people fairly near each other to exchange complex concepts quickly and accurately.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=370s">[06:10]</a> Even the invention of writing, which allowed communication not only over distance but over

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=374s">[06:14]</a> time itself, improved this basic human network so that it could include dead people.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=380s">[06:20]</a> Long after they were gone, even from memories of the next generation or two who met them

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=384s">[06:24]</a> and spoke to them, writing allowed us to incorporate non-living humans into the human network and

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=390s">[06:30]</a> the modern internet has allowed us to include computers and databases into that network

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=394s">[06:34]</a> too.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=395s">[06:35]</a> We don't really think of ourselves as networked intelligence, some actual entity called humanity,

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=401s">[06:41]</a> but even just those of us old enough to remember when the internet did not exist, and even

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=406s">[06:46]</a> being exposed to it gradually so it lacked an explosive moment of transition, can see

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=411s">[06:51]</a> a clear difference in the civilization we have now as opposed to then.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=416s">[06:56]</a> Technological changes happen so fast and frequently these days that we are a bit immune to seeing

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=420s">[07:00]</a> how they changed us, but it has still happened.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=424s">[07:04]</a> I wanted to note that though because a bit like cybernetics, networked intelligence is

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=428s">[07:08]</a> one of those things where it happens gradually enough that we might just keep moving the

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=433s">[07:13]</a> bar.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=434s">[07:14]</a> Folks a few centuries from now might be shot through with tons of devices, cloud-storing

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=438s">[07:18]</a> memories outside their head and routinely talk to people by just thinking their direction

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=442s">[07:22]</a> with the technological equivalent of telepathy, and still be talking about how in the future

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=447s">[07:27]</a> people might be cyborgs or network their minds together, not like us of course.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=453s">[07:33]</a> But no matter how integrated human minds might get to be, the human itself is not the networked

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=458s">[07:38]</a> intelligence, it's just a note of it, whether it's an individual or not.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=463s">[07:43]</a> Bob is not the networked intelligence of New York City, he's just a component of it.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=468s">[07:48]</a> On this subject of networks and hive minds, we are obviously very interested in what happens

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=473s">[07:53]</a> to the individual, if they still continue to exist or not, or are free or not, or have

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=478s">[07:58]</a> privacy or not, but the individual is not the network, even if it is a key or irreplaceable

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=485s">[08:05]</a> component.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=486s">[08:06]</a> Who is the network?

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=488s">[08:08]</a> The network is the network.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=490s">[08:10]</a> We have a thought problem that's fairly interesting for developing this notion.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=493s">[08:13]</a> We've talked a lot about copying a human mind onto a computer substrate where the processors

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=499s">[08:19]</a> emulate neurons.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=500s">[08:20]</a> That's an intuitive enough concept for folks, but you can just as easily, well not easily,

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=506s">[08:26]</a> sit millions of people down with pencil and paper and have them perform all those same

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=510s">[08:30]</a> calculations that a computer is doing, storing each result on paper and walking over to hand

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=515s">[08:35]</a> each new bit to another calculator.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=518s">[08:38]</a> We can envision your neurons doing this to make you, we can envision computer chips doing

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=523s">[08:43]</a> this to make you, but there is something passing strange about the idea of a ton of people

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=528s">[08:48]</a> cracking all the calculations out manually, including folks looking at the scenery and

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=533s">[08:53]</a> jotting down data to be sent to a giant skyscraper full of cubicles manned by the team that makes

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=539s">[08:59]</a> up your eyes and optic nerve.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=778s">[12:58]</a> the same rate as a normal human mind.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=781s">[13:01]</a> Get out beyond that and you'll either need some form of FTL communication or you will

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=788s">[13:08]</a> So spreading a hive mind over multiple planets, let alone solar systems, would seem a serious

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=794s">[13:14]</a> I tend to be skeptical about us ever inventing any form of FTL, but even if we grant it for

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1058s">[17:38]</a> it anyway, and a lot of folks were irritated when Alice Krieg showed up in Star Trek First

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1063s">[17:43]</a> Contact, the film not the episode, as the Borg Queen, but it didn't bother me too

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1068s">[17:48]</a> much personally.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1070s">[17:50]</a> The Borg originally spoke with one voice out of a thousand mouths, cold and alien and unified,

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1076s">[17:56]</a> like a sociopathic chorus, so having a single queen talking seemed wrong.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1081s">[18:01]</a> But to be fair the Borg originally were going to be an insectoid hive race but they didn't

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1086s">[18:06]</a> have the budget, so we get the black leather body horror look that seems like something

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1090s">[18:10]</a> out of Clive Barker's Hellraiser franchise, so changes happen and it gave the audience

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1095s">[18:15]</a> a central focus for the villain.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1096s">[18:16]</a> There's also no reason a hive can't have a mouthpiece, it's actually inefficient

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1101s">[18:21]</a> to have a thousand people saying the exact same thing, and a hive doesn't have to be

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1106s">[18:26]</a> homogenous with every member having the same function and status, insect hives aren't

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1110s">[18:30]</a> like that after all, it could be a meat puppet to use as a collective voice or even a semi-independent

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1116s">[18:36]</a> system.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1117s">[18:37]</a> Now the Borg are horrifying in their own right, but the usual thing that bugs people

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1122s">[18:42]</a> about them is that membership tends not to be optional.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1126s">[18:46]</a> Even in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, the rather benevolent Hive Mind of Gaia, which

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1130s">[18:50]</a> still has modest individuality for its members, is plotting galactic takeover and by conscription

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1136s">[18:56]</a> not volunteers.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1138s">[18:58]</a> It was not a popular move with most fans either, myself included, and is often guessed as the

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1143s">[19:03]</a> reason why all future books in the series were set before the incident.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1148s">[19:08]</a> Nonetheless there are tons of examples of good hive minds in science fiction, especially

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1152s">[19:12]</a> when telepathy seemed to be an omnipresent feature even in hard science fiction novels.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1157s">[19:17]</a> A trend I'm glad finally died off in the last couple decades, but common or not, rarely

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1163s">[19:23]</a> do I hear folks speaking of them with enthusiasm.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1166s">[19:26]</a> Pretty much the only member of a hive mind in fiction I like is Neville Clavaine from

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1170s">[19:30]</a> the Revelation Space series.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1172s">[19:32]</a> It probably helps he's a viewpoint character who joins semi-voluntarily, never upgrades

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1177s">[19:37]</a> his implants from the earlier versions that were less connected, and is often on bad terms

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1181s">[19:41]</a> with his own faction, the Conjoiners, so he doesn't exactly cheerlead for them.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1186s">[19:46]</a> They also don't indiscriminately spread and assimilate folks involuntarily either.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1191s">[19:51]</a> Interestingly Clavaine's faction in the books is often in conflict with the other

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1195s">[19:55]</a> faction of humanity that is closest to being a hive mind too, the Demarchists.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1200s">[20:00]</a> They are more of a bunch of intelligences who are networked, so to speak, as like most

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1204s">[20:04]</a> people they have a ton of mental implants but one of theirs, and the key one for their

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1209s">[20:09]</a> specific civilization, is one that tries to go straight democracy, no representatives,

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1214s">[20:14]</a> by having everyone vote on almost everything.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1217s">[20:17]</a> Sort of like if every bill in congress got text messages to you for a vote, only as best

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1222s">[20:22]</a> as I can tell the implants allow them to do it mostly subconsciously and even asleep.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1226s">[20:26]</a> I assume the implants in everyone's head know them individually well enough to guess

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1230s">[20:30]</a> how they'd respond.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1232s">[20:32]</a> Forgetting the specific mechanics, that is kind of the ideal of most versions of democracy

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1237s">[20:37]</a> and its parallels.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1239s">[20:39]</a> Everyone gets a say in what happens because everyone has an investment in the outcome

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1243s">[20:43]</a> and a right to self-determination, so networking folks to make news and details easier to get

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1248s">[20:48]</a> and absorb to make more informed decisions seems ideal.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1253s">[20:53]</a> If you're not really taken too far you get a hive mind where nobody gets any say

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1257s">[20:57]</a> in anything because there's no individuality left over.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1260s">[21:00]</a> The other big issue is the privacy one, and that's a serious issue of the future even

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1265s">[21:05]</a> when you're not telepathically linked to other people.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1268s">[21:08]</a> However in the networked intelligence case, short of a hive mind, I do think that is just

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1274s">[21:14]</a> an artifact of telepathy in science fiction.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1277s">[21:17]</a> We associate telepathy as reading people's minds, not just the equivalent of a phone

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1282s">[21:22]</a> or internet connection, so a method using that will understandably make you figure all

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1287s">[21:27]</a> those minds can read each other and freely look around or even merge.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1291s">[21:31]</a> Again part of why I don't like telepathy in fiction, made up non-science makes for

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1295s">[21:35]</a> bad extrapolations of the future.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1298s">[21:38]</a> Folks end up picturing some mind-eating hive or a bunch of folks joining hands around a

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1302s">[21:42]</a> drum circle to meditate and combine their souls.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1306s">[21:46]</a> My computer, and thus me, is connected to the internet and to you, obviously, or you

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1311s">[21:51]</a> couldn't hear me now.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1312s">[21:52]</a> I've never noticed my smartphone trying to merge into my brain even when I'm holding

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1316s">[21:56]</a> it next to my head or my computer trying to eat my neighbors.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1320s">[22:00]</a> I can read my files from other computers in my house or on a network but only the ones

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1325s">[22:05]</a> I've shared.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1326s">[22:06]</a> When you're doing this stuff with mystical telepathy that presumably can't be done

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1330s">[22:10]</a> or it takes special effort and training.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1332s">[22:12]</a> But when you do it with technology you have to understand how it all works, how brains

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1337s">[22:17]</a> and memory function, to do it in the first place.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1340s">[22:20]</a> So segmenting things off or only sharing specific chosen bits is possible from the outset.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1346s">[22:26]</a> And if I want people to know what my schedule is, I can make that open just like my Google

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1351s">[22:31]</a> Calendar, or if I want only my doctor to be able to look at my medical status, I can do

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1356s">[22:36]</a> that too.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1357s">[22:37]</a> So I think when we're talking about a technological route to a more networked intelligence, we

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1362s">[22:42]</a> do not necessarily have to discard privacy and individuality to gain the many obvious

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1367s">[22:47]</a> benefits.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1368s">[22:48]</a> You also probably don't have to go the all in or out option, one size fits all.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1374s">[22:54]</a> Living in a city traditionally cuts down privacy a bit, hence many of us prefer the peace and

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1378s">[22:58]</a> solitude of the country, doesn't mean we're divorced from civilization.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1382s">[23:02]</a> So too, one can presumably set up such a network to allow people variable involvement to fit

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1388s">[23:08]</a> their tastes, in general and at the moment.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1392s">[23:12]</a> Also just like civilization you could enjoy sub-networks, I'm part of humanity and the

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1397s">[23:17]</a> US and my state of Ohio and my little village and dozens of various related and unrelated

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1402s">[23:22]</a> social or professional groups, my level of involvement in each varies, and I can adjust

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1408s">[23:28]</a> my commitment.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1409s">[23:29]</a> You could have a human overmind with say the sub-mind of Ohio, which was both a separate

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1414s">[23:34]</a> entity and part of the Earth Mind at the same time, and how much so might fluctuate, as

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1419s">[23:39]</a> might its membership, with some joining or leaving and involving themselves to varying

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1424s">[23:44]</a> degrees.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1425s">[23:45]</a> Werner Wiench explores this notion with a race called the Tynes in his classic novel

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1430s">[23:50]</a> A Fire Upon the Deep, where we see small group minds of often just a few critters that often

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1435s">[23:55]</a> switch members who are not really individuals on their own.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1439s">[23:59]</a> There are a lot of options for this in fiction, but I would tend to guess people who predict

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1443s">[24:03]</a> this as an eventuality for humans are semi-correct.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1447s">[24:07]</a> Just my guess but the error being made is that folks don't want to give up their privacy

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1451s">[24:11]</a> and individuality and must eventually mature to be okay with that, and I personally don't

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1456s">[24:16]</a> see that as more mature or necessary, that you have to sacrifice privacy or individuality

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1462s">[24:22]</a> to enjoy the benefits of a greater degree of networking and group cooperation, though

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1468s">[24:28]</a> I could easily see a lot of folks choosing that route and so long as admission is voluntary

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1473s">[24:33]</a> more power to them.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1475s">[24:35]</a> Obviously if you're too interdependent it makes it hard to get out there and settle

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1478s">[24:38]</a> the galaxy and we'll be looking at a first step to that next week in Colonizing the

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1482s">[24:42]</a> Oort Cloud, which contains tons of potential places for us to colonize but usually so far

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1488s">[24:48]</a> apart even compared to planets that no unified hive mind would be viable.

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1493s">[24:53]</a> The week after that, we'll leave the solar system and continue to explore the problems

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1497s">[24:57]</a> with unification, especially with light speed limitations, in Interstellar Empires, and

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1503s">[25:03]</a> Then we'll finish out 2017 by heading out of the galaxy and asking if it is even possible

<a href="https://youtu.be/NV7_abwM2ug?si=uyulq0QT4mNZP0a9&t=1508s">[25:08]</a> to settle other galaxies in a universe without faster than light travel.
